(* The numbers of the Rocq model, and OCaml's.

   The model's numbers are extracted as they are, binary: [positive], [Z] and
   [nat] (middle_end/flambda2/rocq/FlambdaExtract.v). This is the conversion
   between them and the numbers of the compiler. It is trusted, like the
   converter of types that uses it (type_converter.ml), and is meant to be read:
   every conversion goes through the bits of a number, least significant first.

   An integer of the compiler (an immediate, an [int8] to a [nativeint], a tag,
   a size) is the [Z] of its signed value. A bit pattern (a float, a vector, a
   mask) is the [Z] of its bits read as an integer in two's complement, as the
   integers are: of 32 bits for a float32, of 64 for a float and for a mask, and
   of 128, 256 and 512 for the vectors, whose words are given with [word0] the
   least significant. This is the reading of [const_in_range]
   (middle_end/flambda2/rocq/FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.v) and of the converter of
   terms (middle_end/flambda2/tests/tools/flsemantics.ml). Back from the model,
   a number that is outside the range of what it is to become has no conversion:
   the functions answer [None], and never reduce a number modulo anything. *)
