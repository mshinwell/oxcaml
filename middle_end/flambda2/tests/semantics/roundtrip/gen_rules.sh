# Writes the dune rules that take each example through fexpr and back, for
# run/dune to include (see dune). The arguments are the .fl files of the
# directory above and of ../ocaml, and the .expected files that are here. The
# rules are for run/, so they name the files with one more ../ .
#
# An example ../X.fl has the name X, and ../ocaml/X.fl the name ocaml_X. If
# NAME.expected is here, what the tool prints is compared with it. If not,
# the tool must print that the round trip is the same, or that the example is
# not converted (check.sh).
