# Writes the dune rules for the OCaml examples of this directory, for
# run/dune to include (see dune). The arguments are the .ml, .mli, .fl and
# .expected files that are here. The rules are for run/, so they name the
# files here with ../ .
#
# The sources are compiled with the standard library that the compiler of
# the context finds (%{ocaml_where}), and so, in the context in which the
# tests are run, with the one that the build of this tree made with its own
# compiler; in another context it would be that of another compiler. So the
# two rules that make a term again and compare it with the one kept are for
# the context main only. A term depends on the interfaces of the library,
# and is made again when one of them changes. The two rules that run the
# tool on the term kept and compare what it prints are for every context, as
# those of the directory above are: they need no library.
