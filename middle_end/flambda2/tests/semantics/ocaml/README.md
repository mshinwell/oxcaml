# Units made from OCaml sources

Each `X.ml` here is a small OCaml program. `X.fl` is the Flambda 2 term
that the compiler makes of it for Simplify, and `X.expected` is what the
test tool (`../../tools/flsemantics.ml`) says of that term: it runs
Simplify on it, runs the term before and the term after on the machine
extracted from the Rocq semantics, and asks the extracted validator
whether the term after refines the term before
(`rocq/HACKING.md`, "Testing Simplify against the semantics").

## How a term is made

    sh from_ocaml.sh <ocamlopt> X.ml X.fl

which is, in a directory of its own,

    ocamlopt -nopervasives -nostdlib -stop-after middle_end -c \
      [X.mli] X.ml -drawfexpr-to X.fl

and then

    flsemantics.exe X.fl

The dune rules of this directory do both for every `X.ml` (with the
compiler that builds the tool, which is built from the same sources),
compare the term made with `X.fl` and what the tool prints with
`X.expected`, and fail on a difference:

    dune build --root=. --workspace=duneconf/main.ws \
      @middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/runtest

- `-drawfexpr` prints the unit after the conversion from Lambda (closure
  conversion) and before Simplify. The tool runs Simplify itself, with
  the default flags, on what the parser reads back.
- `-nopervasives -nostdlib`: the unit refers to no other unit, so each
  source declares the primitives it uses (`external ( + ) : int -> int ->
  int = "%addint"`). This changes nothing in what the front end makes of
  an expression.
- `X.mli` exports `result` only, in most units. A function that the
  unit exports is a field of the module block, and Simplify makes its
  closure a symbol; the units named `..._exported.ml` are about
  that.
- A function whose inlining an example is about has `[@inline]`: with
  the default flags Simplify inlines only the smallest functions.
- The sources are formatted by `ocamlformat`, as `make fmt` wants, but
  for those that it does not read, which `.ocamlformat-ignore` names:
  the sources that have an unboxed tuple, a parameter marked `local_`
  or the literal of an immutable array.

## What the conversion does to a unit

The test tool converts the compiler's term to a term of the model
(`../../tools/flsemantics.ml`; it is trusted, and
`rocq/TRUST-LEDGER.md` lists it). Three things it does matter to a
unit made from OCaml.

- **Regions.** Where a block, a boxed number or a closure does not
  escape, the compiler allocates it on the stack, in a region that it
  opens and closes around the expression (`Begin_region`,
  `End_region`). The model has no regions and frees nothing. The
  conversion drops the opening of a region, makes its closing return
  the unit value, and converts what is allocated in it as if it were on
  the heap. That is right for a unit in which nothing allocated in a
  region is used after the region has ended, which the modes of the
  type checker are there to ensure and nothing in the middle end
  checks. It is assumed of the unit after Simplify as of the unit
  before: a validation does not establish that Simplify keeps the uses
  of a local allocation within the life of its region (discrepancy
  V2-3). The regions around a `try` are dropped in the same way: the
  handler ends the regions that the body had open when it raised, and
  nothing allocated in one of them is assumed to be used after that.
  The `Let` by which the handler ends the region is kept, bound to
  `%opaque` of the unit value: Simplify does not delete that primitive
  for being unused, so a handler that begins with it is not a
  continuation that only applies another, and the validator must not
  take it for one.
  `match_variant_local.ml` is `match_variant.ml` without the type
  annotation that keeps the argument of its function on the heap; both
  are validated. Other early examples have such an annotation for the
  same reason.
- **Depths.** The depth variables of recursion, and the coercions that
  mention them, are dropped.
- **Poison.** Where two branches meet with a variant, Simplify unboxes
  it and gives the fields that a branch has not got the constant
  `poison`. The conversion makes it the poison constant of the model
  (`FlambdaModel.Poison`), of the kind it carries; the unit is then run
  and compared like any other (`option_join.ml`).
- **Tupled functions.** `let f (a, b) = ...` may be compiled as code
  that takes the two components, with a mark that says a call of
  unknown arity gives it the pair. The model's code has the mark, and
  every call of the model gives such code its first argument as the
  pair; the arguments after it, if there are any, are given as they
  are and make the call an over-application
  (`FlambdaSemanticsSpec.arguments_for_code`). So a call of unknown
  arity is converted as it is (`tupled_function.ml`). A direct call,
  and a call of known arity, give the code the components, which the
  model has not got yet: a direct call of tupled code that the unit
  binds is refused, and so is a call of known arity in a unit that
  binds tupled code. A function with a pair pattern is not always
  tupled code: the code that `nested_tuple.ml` makes takes one
  parameter, the pair, which the call allocates.

## What the verdicts mean

- **validated**: the extracted `validate_unit` accepted the pair. By
  `FlambdaValidateSpec.validate_unit_sound`, the unit after Simplify
  refines the unit before, run on its own from empty environments. This
  is a theorem about this compilation. It rests on what
  `rocq/TRUST-LEDGER.md` lists (the conversion of the compiler's terms
  to the model's) and, for a unit made from OCaml, on the printing of
  `-drawfexpr` and the fexpr parser: what is validated is the term the
  parser reads back, which is the term the compiler simplifies only as
  far as printing and parsing lose nothing.
  What the theorem observes at the exit is the continuation and its
  arguments, here the symbol of the unit; the contents of the module
  block are not part of the statement.
  Where the verdict says that closures and blocks were lifted to
  symbols, the validator first made static bindings, in the term
  before, of the `Let`s that Simplify lifted
  (`FlambdaLiftSpec.lift_unit`, under the conditions of that file: one
  is that the unit exits with constants and symbols only). The theorem
  is the same one.
  Where the verdict ends "at the head of the term after too", the
  validator removed from the groups of static bindings at the head
  of the term after the code and the closures that nothing uses, as
  it removes them from the term before, and then found the two terms
  the same. That the term after refines the term without them is a
  law of a unit run on its own from empty environments
  (`FlambdaUnusedHeadStaticsSpec.v`, under the checks of
  `head_statics_removable`). The theorem is the same one.
  Where the verdict says "the tables of the term after bound in the
  term before", a lifting named static immutable arrays that the
  term after binds and the term before does not, the validation
  bound them at the head of the term before
  (`FlambdaUnusedHeadStaticsSpec.add_head_tables`, under its two
  checks). The line says that and no more. In the four units of
  this directory that have it, a round of the term before then
  made a `Switch` whose arms give a continuation the elements of
  such an array the load from it
  (`FlambdaMergeTablesSpec.merge_tables`, T1's). The theorem is the
  same one.
  Where the verdict has a second line, "at the second asking", the
  validator refused the pair as it is, and the tool asked
  `validate_unit_knowing` (`FlambdaValidateKnowingSpec.v`): the same
  check of the two terms, each normalised first by rounds in front of
  which the aliases are followed knowing what the symbols are bound
  to. What it accepts is correct of the unit in the same way
  (`FlambdaValidateKnowingProofs.validate_unit_knowing_sound`).
- **validated with its imports**: the unit names a symbol of another
  unit, here always a predefined exception, and the tool runs both
  terms from the static environment of their imports
  (`FlambdaImportsSpec.imports_statics`), where such a symbol is
  bound to an imported value whose contents are unknown; the two
  lines of the runs say "with its import". The validator accepted
  the pair, and its verdict passes a test with which the theorem
  from the imports is proved: the tool asks
  `FlambdaValidateImportsSpec.verdict_holds_from` of the verdict
  (`verdict_knowing_holds_from` of a verdict of the second asking;
  `validate_unit_sound_verdict_imports_statement` and
  `validate_unit_knowing_sound_verdict_imports_statement`). Three
  verdicts pass it whatever the imports are: the same up to bound
  names, once normalised, once the unused static bindings of the
  term before are removed. The verdict that removes unused static
  bindings from the head of the term after too passes it where no
  import is a name that the groups at the head of the term after
  bind, once the validation has normalised and tidied that term
  (`imp_head_inlined_at_one_call.ml` and
  `imp_head_include_functor_result.ml`). The verdict that lifts
  passes it where three things hold
  (`lifted_holds_from`): that same test of the head of the term
  after, where the checks of the removal of bindings from that head
  pass, whether a binding goes or not; no import is a name that the
  lifted term binds, at each step of the validation whose law from
  the imports asks it (the result of each lifting that is made; the
  term in which what the unit binds its symbols to is used, in each
  round in which it is; both terms whose static bindings are taken
  first, where the verdict is of that comparison); and, where a
  lifting is given a table to put at the head of the unit, no import
  is a symbol that the groups at the head of the unit bind after
  that step, whether the table is put or not. The test computes
  again the terms that the validation
  compares, with rounds that stop where those of the validation
  stop; it is of those terms, not of the two terms as the unit has
  them. It is sufficient and not necessary: a unit that fails it
  may be correct from its imports. The unit after then refines the
  unit before, each run from the same imports, whatever they are.
  No line of a unit that has imports begins "validated:".
- **validated with nothing imported**, followed by **not validated
  with its imports**: the validator accepted the pair and its
  verdict does not pass that test. What is proved is of the two
  units run from the empty static environment, where the imported
  symbol is bound to nothing. It says nothing of the two runs
  shown, and their comparison is a test and no more. Such a unit is
  counted apart. No unit of this directory has these lines with the
  tool of this tree: the six that had them when the verdict that
  lifts passed no test from the imports (`array_length_twice.ml`,
  `never_returns_in_function.ml`, `never_returns_twice.ml`,
  `string_get_checked.ml`, `try_exported.ml`,
  `try_result_matched.ml`) are validated with their imports (C5's
  statement of that verdict from the imports).
- **validated for the term as read, which says never null of a value
  that may be null** (discrepancy T4-13): the tool's verdict is
  "validated", and the tables count the unit apart. The text that
  `-drawfexpr` prints cannot say that a value may be null where it
  writes a kind, which it does in a field of the shape of a block
  and in an arity of more than one component: the parser reads every
  kind of values that is written as one that is never null
  (`middle_end/flambda2/parser/fexpr_to_flambda.ml`). As far as
  this loss goes, the model's term before is the compiler's all the
  same, as the conversion drops these kinds, and it is the term
  after that can differ from the compiler's, where Simplify used
  the kind: told that a value is never null, the tool's Simplify
  can remove a test of null that the compiler's keeps. (The other
  things that the printed term loses are under "What a validation
  does not say".) So what is validated is the tool's Simplify of
  the term as read. That a unit is in this row does not say that
  its term after differs from the compiler's: it says that nothing
  in the tree shows that it does not. Nothing in the tree finds these
  units, as the text is where the kind is lost: the list of the
  first thirteen was made twice outside it, by compiling each unit
  with a compiler whose printer writes the mark (T4) and by
  comparing the term in the compiler's memory with the term read
  back (X5), and the two lists are the same. A third way gives the
  same list: reading what `-drawflambda` prints, which marks such a
  kind, for the places where the text writes a kind
  (`middle_end/flambda2/rocq/status/V2.md` says what is read); every
  unit is looked at so before it enters this directory. The
  fourteenth, `ignored_second_of_pair.ml`, was found so when it
  entered: a function there returns two values, and the arity of
  its result, which the text writes where the code is declared and
  where it is called, has two kinds that may be null. For each of
  the first
  thirteen, the term after of the compiler's own run and the
  tool's, as printed, have since been found the same up to names
  (X5; see "What a validation does not say", which says what that
  comparison leaves out). That comparison is older than the
  fourteenth unit, and nothing is said here of its two terms after.
- **the same, not validated**: the two runs came to the same result,
  which is a test of one run and no proof. The validator could not make
  the two terms the same; the table says what it is missing.
- **nothing to validate, as the term before is undefined**: the machine
  has no step somewhere in the run of the term before, so anything
  refines it and a validation would say nothing. The compiler runs
  these programs: the model is what lacks something, and the table
  says what. Such a unit is not counted as validated; where the
  validator accepts one all the same, the tool says so on a line of its
  own.
- **not checked**: the conversion refused the unit, as it has something
  the model has not got.

## The examples

Each source begins with a comment that says what it shows and what
Simplify does to it. Steps are those of the machine, before and after
Simplify. The names in brackets are the streams whose work in progress
is the rewrite that is missing.

370 sources: 310 validated; 14 validated for the term as read, which
says never null of a value that may be null (T4-13); 34 validated with
their imports; none validated with nothing imported and not with its
imports; 6 compared on one run and not validated, one of them a unit
with an import; 1 undefined in the model; 5 not checked.

### What the validation of a unit that exports a function rests on

Of the validated units, those that export a function are validated
through the lifting of closures and blocks to symbols in the term
before. What each shows, and what its validation uses besides:

| Source | What Simplify does | What the validation uses |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| `exported_function.ml` | inlines the call; the exported closure becomes a symbol | the closure lifted to a symbol in the term before |
| `exported_two_functions.ml` | two exported functions, the second calling the first: inlines the calls, makes both closures symbols, and removes from the second the value slot that held the first | the closures lifted to symbols and the unused value slot removed in the term before |
| `exported_table.ml` | an exported function that reads a field of a constant pair of the module, the field being a function: the code of the function, which stays, returns the symbol of that function, and the value slot that held the pair is removed | the closures and the pair lifted to symbols, the projection of the pair from the closure and the load from the pair folded in the code, and the unused value slot removed |
| `exported_capture.ml` | an exported function that uses a value of the module computed when the module runs: its closure becomes a symbol that holds the value in a value slot, its code is bound after the value is computed, and where the function is inlined the slot is read as the variable | the closure lifted to a symbol, the value slot read from the static closure, and the bindings of code moved up in both terms |
| `exported_apply.ml` | an exported function given to another exported function: inlines both calls; the call of the argument, once the first is inlined, is a call of the symbol of the function | the closures lifted to symbols and the indirect call of the symbol made a direct call of its code, which is then inlined |
| `exported_made.ml` | a pair made by an exported function that is called when the module runs: inlines the call, and makes the pair that the inlined call makes a symbol | in two liftings: the closure of the function in the term before as given, then the pair in the term that this gives once normalised |
| `exported_record.ml` | a record made by one exported function and read by another, both called when the module runs with an argument that is not known; the closures of the two functions become symbols | closures and blocks lifted to symbols in the term before |
| `exported_variant.ml` | a value of a variant type made when the module runs, with an argument that is not known, and an exported function that tests it, called on that value; the block and the closure become symbols | closures and blocks lifted to symbols in the term before |
| `exported_list.ml` | a list of three elements whose head is not known until the module runs; its cells become symbols | closures and blocks lifted to symbols in the term before |
| `exported_local_fun.ml` | an exported function with a function of its own inside, which it calls; its closure becomes a symbol | closures and blocks lifted to symbols in the term before |
| `exported_curried.ml` | an exported function of two arguments, called with both when the module runs | closures and blocks lifted to symbols in the term before |
| `exported_nested_pair.ml` | a constant pair of pairs, and an exported function that reads a field of a field of it | closures and blocks lifted to symbols in the term before, and the loads from the constants of the module folded in the code of the function |
| `exported_funs_in_pair.ml` | two functions in a pair, and an exported function that calls the first | closures and blocks lifted to symbols in the term before, and unused value slots removed |
| `exported_chain.ml` | three exported functions, each calling the one before twice | closures and blocks lifted to symbols in the term before, and unused value slots removed |
| `exported_string_length.ml` | a constant string of the module, and an exported function that returns its length | closures and blocks lifted to symbols in the term before, and the length of the constant computed in the code of the function |
| `exported_record_update.ml` | a constant record, an exported function that makes a record from another with one field changed, and a call of it on the constant when the module runs | closures and blocks lifted to symbols in the term before |
| `exported_bool.ml` | an exported predicate, and an exported function that uses it on each of its two arguments with `&&` | closures and blocks lifted to symbols in the term before, and unused value slots removed |
| `exported_after_effect.ml` | a value that is not known until the module runs, then an exported function, then a call of the function on the value | closures and blocks lifted to symbols in the term before |
| `exported_twice_kept.ml` | a function that takes a function and is always inlined, given an exported function that is never inlined: the two calls of the argument, in the code of the function that gives it, stay, as direct calls | closures and blocks lifted to symbols in the term before, and unused value slots removed. It takes two things together: the calls of the argument are left alone on both sides, as the code called is in the list of code not to inline (the term after still calls it), and in the term before the indirect calls of the symbol of the argument are made direct in the code, as Simplify leaves them (`FlambdaKnownSymbolsSpec.fold_known_apply`). Without the second it is not validated: the two terms then differ in the kind of those calls only. With every call inlined on both sides in place of the first it is not validated either: the term after is left with a continuation applied once, which its normalisation does not inline |
| `exported_compose_kept.ml` | the composition of two exported functions that are never inlined, by a function that is always inlined: the two calls stay, in the code of the composition, as direct calls | as `exported_twice_kept.ml` |
| `exported_branch_then_fun.ml` | a value chosen by a test that is not resolved when the module runs, then an exported function that uses it: the closure of the function becomes a symbol that holds the value in a value slot, and the symbol and its code are bound in the handler of the continuation that the test goes to | the closure lifted to a symbol in the term before and all the code of the term after bound first |
| `exported_match_then_fun.ml` | a value taken out of an option that is not known, then a predicate that uses it: as the one before, after a match | as the one before |
| `exported_branch_two_funs.ml` | a value chosen by a test, then two functions, the second calling the first: inlines the call; both closures become symbols, bound with their code in the handler | the closures lifted to symbols, the unused value slot removed and the code of the term after bound first |
| `exported_fun_branch_fun.ml` | a function, then a value chosen by a test, then a function that uses both: the code of the second function, with the call of the first inlined, is bound in the handler | as the one before |
| `exported_two_branches.ml` | two values, each chosen by a test, with a function after each, the second function calling the first: the code of each function is bound in the handler of its test, the second handler inside the first | as the one before |
| `exported_branch_pair.ml` | one of two constant pairs chosen by a test, then a function that reads it: the pairs become symbols, and the closure a symbol that holds the one chosen | the closure lifted to a symbol in the term before and the code of the term after bound first |
| `exported_branch_calls_twice.ml` | as `exported_branch_two_funs.ml`, the second function calling the first twice: inlines both calls, and reads the value slot of the first closure once | as `exported_branch_two_funs.ml`; with the two calls inlined in the term before, the value slot is projected twice, and the second projection is made the variable of the first (`FlambdaShareProjectionsSpec.share_known_projections`) |
| `exported_some_again.ml` | a value that is not known until the module runs, put in an option that a function which is always inlined takes apart, and kept in another option: the first option is gone, and the second is a symbol | the closure and the second option lifted to symbols: the test tool gives the symbol to the first block of its shape, which is the first option, finds it unused in the end, and guesses again without it |
| `exported_fun_given.ml` | a function that gives, to the function it is given, a function which needs nothing from around it: the closure given is a symbol, bound beside the code of the function that gives it | the closure lifted out of the code of the function in the term before (`FlambdaLiftFromCodeSpec.lift_from_code_unit`) |
| `exported_fun_returned.ml` | a function that returns a function of its own which needs nothing from around it: the closure returned is a symbol | as the one before |
| `exported_funs_given.ml` | a function that gives two such functions: both closures are symbols | the two closures lifted out of the code; they are bound in the order of their `Let`s, which is not the order in which Simplify binds them, and the static bindings of a group are compared whatever their order |
| `exported_fun_in_option.ml` | a function that returns an option of such a function: the closure and the option are symbols | the closure lifted out of the code in a first lifting and the option in a second, which puts it before the closure; the order again |
| `exported_fun_to_map.ml` | a recursive function on lists, which is not inlined, and a function that gives it a function which needs nothing from around it: the closure given is a symbol | the closure lifted out of the code of the function that gives it, the calls of the recursive function left as they are, and the unused value slot removed |
| `exported_local_never.ml` | a function with a function of its own inside, which is never inlined and needs nothing from around it: the closure of the inner function is a symbol | the closure lifted out of the code of the outer function, and the calls of the inner function left as they are |
| `exported_option_library.ml` | three functions on options, as a small library has them (`map`, `default`, `is_some`): nothing is known of their arguments, and the three closures are symbols | closures and blocks lifted to symbols in the term before |
| `exported_length.ml` | the length of a list, a recursive function that is not a loop: its closure is a symbol and it calls itself through it | closures and blocks lifted to symbols in the term before |
| `exported_const_list.ml` | a constant list and a function that reads its head: the match is resolved in the code of the function | closures and blocks lifted to symbols in the term before |
| `exported_record_of_funs.ml` | a record of two functions and a function that calls one of them through the record: the call is of the symbol of the function, and is inlined | closures and blocks lifted to symbols in the term before, and unused value slots removed |
| `exported_submodule.ml` | a module inside the module, and a function outside it that calls a function of the inner module twice: the calls are inlined | closures and blocks lifted to symbols in the term before, and unused value slots removed |
| `exported_two_somes.ml` | two options, each of a value that is not known until the module runs: each is a symbol with a variable in its field | the two blocks lifted to symbols in the term before |
| `exported_branch_option.ml` | an option chosen by a test when the module runs, and a function that reads it with a default | the closure lifted to a symbol in the term before and the code of the term after bound first |
| `exported_branch_then_const.ml` | a value chosen by a test, then a constant pair and a function that reads the pair and the value: the two loads from the pair and their sum are folded | as the one before |
| `exported_branch_fun_const.ml` | a test when the module runs, then two functions that do not use what it chose, the second calling the first twice | as the one before, with the unused value slot removed |
| `exported_match_pair_then_fun.ml` | a pair that is not known until the module runs, taken apart, and a function that uses both parts | the closure lifted to a symbol in the term before, with the two parts in its value slots |
| `exported_nested_branch.ml` | a value chosen by two tests, one inside the other, and a function that uses it: its code is bound in the handler of the continuation that the three arms go to | the closure lifted to a symbol in the term before and the code of the term after bound first |
| `exported_fun_in_arms.ml` | a function chosen by a test when the module runs, each arm making a function that needs nothing from around it: the two closures are symbols | the closures lifted to the head of the unit in the term before, and the two terms compared with their static bindings that mention no variable bound first |
| `exported_fun_in_one_arm.ml` | a test when the module runs, between a function defined before it and a function made in the other arm: the closure of the arm is a symbol | as the one before |
| `exported_arms_after_let.ml` | a function that makes a function in each arm of a test, and the same test made when the module runs on a value computed before it: the four closures of the arms are symbols | the closures lifted out of the code and to the head of the unit in the term before, and the two terms compared with their static bindings that mention no variable bound first |
| `exported_two_tests.ml` | two tests when the module runs, one after the other: the first chooses a number, the second a function, whose closures are symbols | as `exported_fun_in_arms.ml` |
| `exported_funs_in_arms_used.ml` | a function chosen by a test when the module runs, and a function defined after the test that calls it twice: the closures of the arms are symbols | as `exported_fun_in_arms.ml`, with the closure of the function defined after the test lifted where it stands |
| `exported_option_fun_in_arm.ml` | an option chosen by a test when the module runs, whose contents is a function made in the arm: the closure and the block that holds it are symbols | two liftings to the head of the unit in the term before: the closure, then the block, which mentions no variable once the closure is a symbol; and the two terms compared with their static bindings that mention no variable bound first |
| `exported_pair_fun_in_arms.ml` | a pair chosen by a test when the module runs, of a number and a function made in the arm: the closures and the pairs are symbols | as the one before |
| `exported_records_in_arms.ml` | a record chosen by a test when the module runs, of a function made in the arm and a number: the closures and the records are symbols | as the one before |
| `exported_match_three_funs.ml` | a function chosen by a match of three cases when the module runs: the three closures are symbols, bound below the handler of the inner test, which mentions two of them | as `exported_fun_in_arms.ml` |

### The same on one run, not validated

| Source | Steps | What the validator lacks |
|--------|-------|--------------------------|
| `capture_fun_bound_in_handler_run.ml` | 31, 26 | the closure of the function that is called holds a value chosen by a test when the module runs, so its symbol is bound in the handler of that test; the code of the closure that calls it is bound at the head of the unit and reads it from a value slot, where Simplify puts the symbol; the validation reads a slot only where the symbol it holds is in scope, and leaves this projection (C3) |
| `exn_with_argument.ml` | 37, 10 | the handler reads the length of the string that the exception carries, a constant string of the unit. Simplify has the length. The validator computes the length of a string that the unit binds only in a term in which something was lifted, and nothing is lifted in this unit (V2) |
| `pair_join.ml` | 31, 28 | one branch gives a parameter of the function, and Simplify loads its fields at that use, which only the subkind of the parameter justifies; the model has no subkinds (T6-7) |
| `pair_kept.ml` | 35, 33 | as `pair_join.ml` |
| `pair_loop.ml` | 192, 85 | as `pair_join.ml`, at the entry of a loop, whose parameter Simplify unboxes from its subkind without looking at the uses (T6-7) |
| `rec_helper_called_outside.ml` | 27, 13 | two functions defined together, neither of them recursive: Simplify inlines the second where the unit calls it and leaves the call of it in the code of the first. The validation leaves every call of code that the term after still calls, so it inlines neither: the calls to leave are chosen by code and not by call (V2; `status/V2.md`, a known limit, here in a source with no attribute at a call) |

### Undefined in the model

| Source | Why the term before has no meaning |
|--------|------------------------------------|
| `empty_array_phys_equal.ml` | two empty arrays compared by `==`: the front end makes one symbol of the two, so the comparison is of an allocated value with itself, to which the model gives no value (C4) |

### Not checked

| Source | What the model has not got |
|--------|----------------------------|
| `array_literal.ml` | mutable arrays: `Make_array` (C4) |
| `float_add.ml` | floating-point arithmetic |
| `ref_counter.ml` | mutable fields: `Block_set` (C4) |
| `tupled_recursive.ml` | after Simplify the unit calls tupled code directly, giving it the components; the model has not got that call (C3) |
| `tupled_unknown_pair.ml` | as `tupled_recursive.ml` |

## What stops a unit from validating, most common first

1. A pair that is a parameter of the function, unboxed where two
   branches meet (three units). One branch gives the parameter, and
   Simplify loads its fields at that use, which only the subkind of
   the parameter justifies; the model has no subkinds, so the term
   after is less defined than the term before and no rewrite can be
   proved (`pair_join.ml`, `pair_kept.ml`; discrepancy T6-7).
   `pair_loop.ml` is the same at the entry of a loop, whose parameter
   Simplify unboxes from its subkind without looking at the uses.
2. A value slot that holds a symbol which is not in scope where the
   slot is read (`capture_fun_bound_in_handler_run.ml`). The closure
   of a function holds a value chosen by a test when the module
   runs, so its symbol is bound in the handler of that test; the
   code of a closure that calls the function is bound at the head of
   the unit and reads it from a value slot, where Simplify puts the
   symbol. The validation reads a slot only where the symbol it
   holds is in scope, and leaves this projection.
3. The length of a constant string where nothing is lifted
   (`exn_with_argument.ml`). The handler of an exception that
   carries a string reads the length of what was raised, which is a
   string that the unit binds. Simplify has the length from the type
   of the symbol. The validator computes the length of a string that
   the unit binds only in a term in which something was lifted
   (`FlambdaValidateSpec.normalise_lifted`), and nothing is lifted
   in this unit. The comparison of the exception with the predefined
   one that the handler catches, which stopped this unit and
   `try_not_found.ml`, is folded now (below).
4. A function that Simplify inlines at one of its calls and not at
   another (`rec_helper_called_outside.ml`, T3's source). Two
   functions are defined together with `let rec .. and ..`, neither
   of them recursive; the first calls the second, and the unit calls
   both. Simplify inlines the second where the unit calls it and
   leaves the call of it in the code of the first. The validation is
   told which calls to leave by code and not by call: it leaves
   every call of code that the term after still calls, so the term
   before keeps, at the head of the unit, a call that the term after
   has not. It is the limit that `status/V2.md` describes, here in
   a source that has no attribute at a call.

What the model has not got, and the conversion refuses: floating-point
arithmetic (`float_add.ml`), mutable arrays (`array_literal.ml`),
mutable fields (`ref_counter.ml`), and a direct call of tupled code,
which gives the code the components (`tupled_recursive.ml`,
`tupled_unknown_pair.ml`): Simplify makes one of the call of a tupled
function that it knows and does not inline, so the term after is
refused where the term before is not. A static immutable array of
values and the array with no element are converted
(`../static_array.fl` and the four beside it, `empty_array_length.ml`,
`empty_array_tested.ml`, `empty_array_in_record.ml`,
`empty_arrays_of_two_types.ml`, `empty_immutable_array.ml`; P1's).
The conversion refuses a call that is a probe as well; no unit of
this directory has one (`pairs/README.md`).

What was on this list and is not any more, with the rewrite that
removed it:

- The continuation that makes the module block, applied once inside
  the handler that two branches go to (`if_unknown.ml`): a
  continuation is moved to the handler that alone uses it
  (`FlambdaSinkContsSpec.v`).
- A function that the unit keeps, whose closure becomes a symbol
  (`exported_function.ml`, `factorial.ml`): the validator lifts the
  `Let`s that Simplify lifted (`FlambdaLiftSpec.v`), and uses what the
  unit binds its symbols to (`FlambdaKnownSymbolsSpec.v`).
- Loops whose handler has something to fold (`while_loop.ml`,
  `for_sum.ml`): the rewrites of a round go into the handlers of
  recursive continuations (`FlambdaRecHandlersSpec.v`).
- The identities of arithmetic (`add_zero.ml`):
  `FlambdaIdentitiesSpec.v`.
- A primitive computed twice by the front end and once by Simplify, a
  boxed number unboxed at each use above all: `FlambdaCseSpec.v`.
- A function inlined twice at arguments that are not known
  (`twice_inlined.ml`, `local_function.ml`, `labelled_optional.ml`).
  The two copies of its body bind the same names in the term before,
  one in the scope of the other, and an alias of a name that is bound
  again is not followed, as it must not be; Simplify gives each copy
  names of its own. The validator gives every binder of the term
  before a name of its own once the calls are inlined
  (`FlambdaRenameApartSpec.v`).
- The order in which a group of static bindings binds the code of
  functions that call each other: Simplify builds the group again, in
  an order of its own, and the validator puts the bindings of the term
  before in the order of the term after (`FlambdaStaticsOrderSpec.v`;
  `../statics_order.fl`, written by hand, is validated by that alone).
- A local function given to a function that is inlined, inside a
  function that the unit keeps (`closure_argument_exported.ml`): the
  call becomes direct in the body of code, whose own group has the
  code called; the validator inlines between the code of one group
  (`FlambdaInlineSiblingsSpec.v`).
- A closure of a set that the term does not use
  (`returned_closure_of_pair.ml`): in the model it is the `Let` of a
  projection, which the term before loses by a refinement; the term
  after now loses it by an equivalence
  (`FlambdaUnusedProjectionsSpec.v`).
- A recursive function that the unit keeps and calls (`fib.ml`,
  `list_map.ml`, `factorial.ml`): each round inlined the call once
  more on both sides. The validator is told which calls to leave
  (`FlambdaNormaliseSpec.inline_calls`), and the test tool names the
  recursive code and the code that the term after still calls.
- A function that is never inlined, given to one that always is
  (`exported_twice_kept.ml`): the same list, and the indirect call of
  a symbol that the unit binds to a closure made direct
  (`FlambdaKnownSymbolsSpec.v`).
- Closures made symbols where a value slot is a variable
  (`closed_mutual_recursion.ml`), or where the function is then called
  through a variable (`indirect_call.ml`): the function slots of a
  static set are known whatever its value slots hold
  (`FlambdaKnownSymbolsSpec.v`), and liftings are made in turn.
- An application of a continuation whose handler only applies
  another, a trap action included (`div_unknown.ml`,
  `string_get16_checked.ml`): it goes there directly
  (`FlambdaForwardSpec.v`).
- A parameter of a loop that every application gives the same thing
  (`while_const_after.ml`, `while_nested.ml`): it is bound at the head
  of the handler (`FlambdaParamAliasesSpec.v`), and the parameters of
  loops that are left unused are removed
  (`FlambdaUnusedParamsSpec.v`).
- Exceptions (`try_no_raise.ml`, `mod_zero.ml`, `raise_inlined.ml`;
  twelve units). A `try` installs a handler and removes it. Where
  Simplify finds that nothing can raise to the handler any more, or
  that what is raised is known, it makes the handler an ordinary
  continuation and drops the trap actions. The validator does the
  same at the end of the normalisation of the term before, and after
  the last lifting, and goes through its rounds again
  (`FlambdaDemoteSpec.demote_handlers`,
  `FlambdaValidateSpec.demote_and_tidy`). The conversion keeps, for
  that, the `Let` by which a handler ends its region (see above).
- A continuation whose handler is one jump, bound above a `Let` and
  applied by an arm of a `Switch`, once a call is inlined
  (`option_inlined.ml`): the rounds of the first phase, which send
  the arm where the jump goes, are gone through again after the
  second (`FlambdaValidateSpec.demote_and_tidy`).
- A continuation of no parameters that Simplify leaves with a
  `Switch` on a parameter it removed, every application giving that
  parameter the same constant (`variant_blocks_join.ml`): Simplify
  binds the constant at the head of the handler and the `Switch`
  stays under that `Let`. The folding of constants of the validator
  makes the handler one jump in both terms; the term before has its
  applications forwarded, and the term after has them forwarded by
  an equivalence (`FlambdaForwardKindedSpec.forward_kinded`, in
  `FlambdaValidateSpec.inline_once_applied_after`).
- Two arms of a `Switch` that give one continuation 0 and 1 (two
  generated units of `census/`): Simplify makes of them the tagging
  of what is tested, and so does the validator in both phases of the
  term before (`FlambdaMergeSwitchesSpec.merge_switches`).
- A field of a block loaded twice, once for each pattern of a match
  that looks at it (`list_last.ml`): a load marked immutable is one
  of the primitives that are not computed twice (`FlambdaCseSpec.v`).
- The tagging of a number that is the untagging of a variable
  (`variant_two_blocks.ml`, `variant_nested_match.ml`). A match on a
  variant gives each constant constructor its own number: the front
  end untags the scrutinee to test it, and the arms of those
  constructors pass their numbers as tagged constants, where
  Simplify makes them pass the scrutinee. The merging of the arms of
  a `Switch` makes of those arms the tagging of what is tested
  (`FlambdaMergeSwitchesSpec.merge_switches`). The sharing of
  primitives knows, under the `Let` of an untagging, that the
  variable untagged is the tagging of the result
  (`FlambdaCseSpec.computed_under_let`), so that tagging becomes the
  variable.
- A primitive computed before a `Switch` or a call and again in the
  handler that follows (`string_get_unknown.ml`,
  `string_get_in_branch.ml`, `string_get_twice.ml`,
  `string_get_two_indices.ml`, `string_length_after_join.ml`: the
  index of an access to a string converted for the bounds test and
  again for the load, the length read for each test;
  `field_twice_inlined.ml`: a field loaded before a call and again
  when it returns). Simplify computes it once and, where a
  continuation is reached from several places, gives it to the
  handler as an argument. Once its continuations are placed, each
  term is tidied: a parameter that every application gives one
  variable is taken away, and the sharing of primitives then sees in
  the handler what the `Let` above it computed
  (`FlambdaValidateSpec.tidied_before`, `tidied_after`, N3's, with
  `FlambdaUnaliasParamsSpec.v`).
- A constant block of the unit given to a join in a function or in
  a loop (`option_constant.ml`, `option_constant_loop.ml`,
  `option_constant_loop_fun.ml`, `list_constant.ml`,
  `pair_constants.ml`, `variant_constants.ml`): the unboxing of a
  parameter where branches meet knows, in the code and in the loops
  of the term, the static blocks and boxed numbers of the static
  bindings in scope (`FlambdaUnboxInScopeSpec.v`, T6's).
- A closure that the body of code binds by a `Let` and gives to an
  inlined function, in a unit with two functions that call each
  other (`local_closure_applied_mutual.ml`): the second asking
  follows aliases in the bodies of code too
  (`FlambdaValidateKnowingSpec.follow_aliases_knowing`, T3's).
- A test against zero of the result of `compare`
  (`compare_tested.ml`, `compare_order.ml`,
  `int64_compare_tested.ml`). `compare a b < 0` reaches Simplify as
  a three-way comparison, the tagging of its result and a test of
  that against 0. Simplify makes the test a comparison of the two
  operands, and the three-way comparison goes where nothing else
  uses it. The validator does the same on the term before, with the
  compiler's table case for case
  (`FlambdaRecoverComparisonSpec.recover_known_comparisons`, T5b's).
- Two equal projections of a value slot, which a function inlined
  twice leaves in the term before (`exported_branch_calls_twice.ml`):
  the second is made the variable of the first
  (`FlambdaShareProjectionsSpec.share_known_projections`). Simplify
  finds that variable in the type of the closure, as it does for a
  field loaded twice.
- A variant, a pair or a boxed number unboxed where two branches
  meet, each branch building it (`option_join.ml`, `shape_heap.ml`,
  `pair_built.ml`, `int64_option_heap.ml`): Simplify gives the
  continuation the fields, with `poison` for those that a branch has
  not got, and the validator does the same in the first phase of the
  term before (`FlambdaUnboxVariantsSpec.unbox_variant_params`).
- A variant that is a constant block on one path and a constant
  constructor on the other, unboxed where they meet
  (`shape_constant.ml`): Simplify gives the continuation whether the
  value is an immediate and the field, which is that of the symbol
  of the constant block on one path and `poison` on the other. Under
  a test, the untagging of a symbol has no value, so the unboxing of
  parameters gives a constant in its place
  (`FlambdaUnboxVariantsSpec.no_value_on`).
- A boolean untagged where the two tests of the condition of a loop
  meet (`while_two_tests.ml`, a `while` with `&&`): the first test
  gives the number 0 and the second its comparison, with nothing
  tagged. Under a test, the unboxing of parameters gives, for an
  untagging, the number that a `Let` in scope tagged
  (`FlambdaUnboxVariantsSpec.made_number`).
- A self tail call made a jump (`tail_loop.ml`, `list_length.ml`,
  `list_rev.ml`): where the two terms are not the same as given, the
  validator makes loops of the self tail calls of the code it is told
  (`FlambdaLoopifySpec.v`), and the tool names the code that the front
  end marks for it. The recursive code is in the list of code to
  leave, so the call of the function stays on both sides and the two
  bodies are compared.
- A parameter of a loop that is only passed round the loop
  (`while_unused_counter.ml`): removed (`FlambdaDeadParamsSpec.v`).
- A continuation applied once that Simplify leaves in the term after,
  or that is applied once after the validation has inlined a call
  that Simplify left (`../kinds_partial_application.fl`; 46 of the
  generated units of `census/`): the term after has it moved to where
  it is applied and inlined there, where the checks of the passes
  permit, by equivalences
  (`FlambdaValidateSpec.inline_once_applied_after`).
- In the code of a function of which Simplify makes a loop, a `Let`
  of a parameter of the code that nothing uses (`string_sum.ml`): the
  term after loses it, with the parameters of the code in scope at
  their kinds (`FlambdaCodeLetsSpec.v`).
- A call of a variable bound to a closure of a set at a named function
  slot, which the rounds do not make direct (`tupled_function.ml`,
  whose tupled functions project their own function slot): where the
  validation fails, the tool asks it again with the aliases followed
  by the function that knows more of what is bound
  (`FlambdaValidateKnowingSpec.v`), which makes the call direct; a
  call that gives tupled code its tuple is then inlined
  (`FlambdaNormaliseSpec.inline_apply`). The verdict then has a
  second line that says so. With the rewrites from the types in the
  normalisation of the term before (the next point), that unit is
  validated at the first asking.
- A `Switch` on a variable, in a handler that only one arm of a
  `Switch` on the same variable applies (two generated units of
  `census/`): Simplify, which knows in the arm what the variable is,
  resolves the second. The rewrites that Simplify makes from the
  types are applied to the term before once, between two runs of the
  rounds of its second phase
  (`FlambdaSimplifyPassSpec.simplify_by_types`, computed by
  `FlambdaSimplifyCarriedSpec.simplify_by_types_carried`, in
  `FlambdaValidateSpec.normalise_before`): a handler that is applied
  once is rewritten under what is known where it is applied.
- A closure that calls a function of its module, made by a function
  that stays a function (`capture_fun_and_var_run.ml`,
  `capture_two_funs.ml`, `capture_rec_self.ml`, `over_rec.ml`): the
  closure holds the function in a value slot, and Simplify, which
  knows what the slot holds, makes the code of the closure call the
  symbol of the function. The validator replaces the projection of a
  value slot that every set of closures of the unit gives the same
  symbol or constant by that symbol or constant, where the symbol is
  in scope (`FlambdaKnownSlotsSpec.read_known_slots`, in each round
  of the normalisation of a term in which something was lifted).
- The return continuation of a call, bound above the `Let`s of the
  arguments of the call in the term before and below them in the
  term after (`call_result_unused.ml`, `call_result_tested.ml`; one
  generated unit of `census/`, and 56 of its units with loops).
  Where Simplify changes the parameter of the continuation (a result
  that the handler does not use is not passed; a boolean that an
  `if` tests is untagged), the call can no longer return to it:
  Simplify makes the call return to a new continuation, bound at the
  call, that applies the old one. The comparison is of the bindings
  in their order. The first comparison is of the two terms as they
  are given. Each term of the later comparisons has its
  continuations placed once the rounds are over: a `Let_cont` that
  is not recursive goes down to the call that returns to its
  continuation, or to the test of which an arm names it, where the
  guards of the pass permit. It passes a `Let` whose variable its
  handler does not use, a static binding, and the binding of another
  continuation that is not recursive if neither handler names the
  other; failing that, it goes into the handler of the other where
  nothing under the two bindings names it and the parameters of
  that handler are not used in its own; anything else between the
  two leaves it where it was
  (`FlambdaSinkUsesSpec.sink_conts_to_uses`, an equivalence, in
  `FlambdaValidateSpec.placed`).
- Code and a closure that Simplify leaves bound at the head of the
  term after though nothing uses them (`inlined_at_one_call.ml`,
  `closure_uses_unit_function_only.ml`,
  `include_functor_result.ml`): it left a call of the function,
  which the normalisation has since inlined in both terms. The
  validator removes from the groups at the head of the term after
  the static bindings that nothing uses, where the checks of
  `FlambdaUnusedHeadStaticsSpec.head_statics_removable` pass, and
  says so in its verdict. `closure_uses_unit_function_only.ml` is
  validated at an earlier comparison since: the tool fits the
  closure that the code makes to a symbol whose closure has fewer
  value slots, those that nothing reads once the code reads the
  symbol, which Simplify drops, and the two terms are the same once
  closures are lifted and unused value slots removed (C3's, in the
  guess of the tool; the validation checks the lifting as it does
  any other).
- A function that captures nothing, made in a loop
  (`loop_function_in_kept.ml`, `local_rec_in_tail_loop.ml`,
  `loop_function_twice.ml`): Simplify makes its closure a symbol,
  bound beside the code that has the loop, and has one symbol for
  two `Let`s of the same closure. The liftings out of code and to
  the head of the unit go into the handlers of recursive
  continuations, and two `Let`s of one constant share a symbol
  (`FlambdaLiftFromCodeSpec.v`, `FlambdaLiftFromArmsSpec.v`, V3's);
  the tool guesses the `Let`s to lift out of loops.
- A pair, or an option of a pair, that is a constant on an arm of a
  test and is taken apart where the arms meet
  (`pair_constant_arm.ml`, `pair_constant_arm_toplevel.ml`,
  `pair_two_constants.ml`, where it is one on both arms,
  `match_pair_option_built.ml`). A
  parameter of a join that is a pair or a variant is unboxed as
  Simplify unboxes it (`FlambdaUnboxVariantsSpec.v`, T6's): an arm
  is given the field of its block wherever the block is there, and
  the constant for nothing to read only where the block has another
  tag or is not there at all, whatever else the arm shows of the
  path that the handler takes. The parameters for the fields that
  the handler loads one below another are those of the last field
  first.
- The wrapper of a partial application whose closure stays
  (`partial_exported.ml`). The front end makes the wrapper, as code
  marked `stub`, with a direct call of the function through a value
  slot of the wrapper's own closure. Simplify simplifies the code of
  a stub where the code is bound and not where its closure is made
  (`middle_end/flambda2/simplify/simplify_static_const.ml`), so it
  does not know what the slot holds, and it makes of the direct call
  an indirect call of known arity
  (`middle_end/flambda2/simplify/simplify_apply_expr.ml`;
  discrepancy C3-11). The validator does to the term before what
  Simplify does: the direct calls in the code of a stub are made
  indirect (`FlambdaStubCallsSpec.demote_stub_calls`, a refinement,
  C3's), and value slots are not read in that code
  (`FlambdaKnownSlotsSpec.read_slots`). `../stub_by_hand.fl` and
  `../stub_by_hand_unmarked.fl`, written by hand, are one unit with
  its code marked as a stub and not: both are validated.
- The load of a character of a string that is a constant of the
  unit, at a constant index (`string_get_checked.ml`). The validator
  computed it where Simplify keeps the load
  (`simplify_string_or_bigstring_load` of
  `middle_end/flambda2/simplify/simplify_binary_primitive.ml`
  answers that it knows nothing of the result), so the two terms
  differed the other way. The fold at known symbols leaves that load
  now (`FlambdaKnownSymbolsSpec.reads_string`, N3's); the length of
  a known string is still folded, as Simplify computes it. The unit
  has an import, and the comparison that accepts the pair is one
  that lifts: it is validated with its imports, since that verdict
  has a test from the imports (C5's).
- The comparison of a predefined exception with itself
  (`try_not_found.ml`). A handler that catches an exception by name
  compares what was raised with the predefined exception, a symbol
  that the unit imports. Where Simplify knows what was raised, the
  two are the same symbol: it folds the comparison to true and drops
  the arm that raises again. The validator folds a `Phys_equal` of a
  simple against itself to its answer in the term before
  (`FlambdaSameComparisonSpec.fold_same_comparisons`). It is a
  refinement: where the machine gives the comparison of a value with
  itself an answer it is that one
  (`FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.phys_equal_same_statement`, C5's), and
  where it gives none the term before is undefined.
- A call whose result is only passed on
  (`call_result_passed_on.ml`): where the handler of the return
  continuation of a call applies another continuation to its
  parameters as they are, Simplify makes the call return there, and
  so does the validation for the term before, once, when its rounds
  are over (`FlambdaValidateSpec.with_returns`, with
  `FlambdaForwardSpec.forward_applications_with`, V4's). It leaves
  the calls of the term before where the term after still has such a
  call. In the unit that showed it, Simplify left the call because
  the handler ended the region of a block on the caller's stack
  before it passed the result on, which the conversion drops.
- A continuation that the two terms bind on either side of a `Let`
  (`inlined_test_join.ml`, `loop_exit_inlined.ml`): the placing of
  continuations moves a binding down as far as the bindings under
  it allow, where it moved one only if it reached a use
  (`FlambdaSinkUsesSpec.sink_conts_to_uses`, V4's).
- An application that Simplify leaves going through a continuation
  whose handler is one jump (`local_block_matched.ml`,
  `local_block_matched_argument.ml`, `loop_result_passed_round.ml`,
  `try_result_matched.ml`): the term before had it forwarded or not
  by a guess at what Simplify would leave. The term after has such
  an application forwarded where its arguments are known to have
  the kinds of the parameters, an equivalence
  (`FlambdaForwardKindedSpec.forward_kinded`, V4's), and the term
  before has every one forwarded.
- A helper that a function which is kept holds in a value slot, and
  that Simplify inlines there (`helper_inlined_in_closure.ml`,
  `hidden_helper_inlined_twice.ml`): Simplify removes the slot, the
  closure of the helper and its code. The removal of unused value
  slots is followed by the removal of the `Let`s that nothing uses
  any more, in the term and in its code
  (`FlambdaValidateSpec.without_slots`, V3's), so that the code goes
  with the unused static bindings.
- Blocks of two tags that come to one load
  (`join_tags_then_shared_field.ml`, `two_tags_shared_field.ml`).
  Where both arms of a test give a join a block, of two tags, and
  the handler loads a field that the constructors share without a
  `Switch` on the tag, Simplify keeps the two `Make_block`, the
  parameter and the load, since its parameters for the fields of a
  variant are by tag; the unboxing of the term before now leaves
  them too (`FlambdaUnboxVariantsSpec.loads_of_two_tags`, T6's),
  where it made the load a parameter.
- A call of a function that never returns (`never_returns_twice.ml`,
  `never_returns_in_function.ml`). Simplify finds that the code
  called does not return, and gives the call no return continuation;
  the conversion makes that a call that returns to a continuation
  whose handler is `Invalid`. In the term before, a direct call of
  code in sight whose body does not mention its return continuation
  is put under a binding of its own return continuation to such a
  handler (`FlambdaNeverReturnsSpec.cut_returns`, C5's). Both units
  have an import, the exception that the function raises, and are
  validated once closures are lifted, with their imports.
- A block or a closure that Simplify binds to a symbol outside the
  handler in which the source makes it
  (`block_in_arm_of_unknown.ml`, `closure_in_arm_of_unknown.ml`:
  made in the arm of a test from a value that is computed before
  the test, and bound before the test), and a boxed number that
  Simplify computes and has one symbol for
  (`boxed_constant_twice.ml`, `boxed_constant_made.ml`). A lifting
  names the `Let`s to make aliases of symbols that a group of
  static bindings around them binds, and the `Let_cont`s before
  which such a group is put
  (`FlambdaLiftAroundSpec.lift_around_unit`, V3's). The tool
  guesses both from its second lifting on: a `Let` that makes just
  what a symbol in scope is bound to becomes that symbol.
- A helper that a function which is kept calls through a value slot
  of its own closure, and that Simplify inlines there
  (`helper_called_through_slot.ml`). Simplify removes the closure
  of the helper, so the term after has no symbol for it, and the
  tool gave symbols only to the closures that a symbol of the term
  after fits: the slot held a variable, and the calls stayed
  indirect. The tool now gives such a closure symbols of its own,
  which neither term binds or mentions (V3's). The validation does
  the rest as it did: the slot holds a symbol, the projection in
  the code is that symbol, the call is direct and is inlined, the
  slot is dropped, and the symbols go with the unused static
  bindings.
- The length of an array taken twice (`array_length_twice.ml`: a
  recursive function over an array takes the length for its test,
  and a checked read takes it again). `Array_length` is one of the
  primitives that are not computed twice
  (`FlambdaCseSpec.shareable`), as it is in Simplify. The unit has
  an import and is validated once closures are lifted, with its
  imports.
- A box that a join is given after the term has unboxed it
  (`int64_max.ml`, `int64_clamp.ml`: the greater of two boxed
  integers, where the comparison unboxes both and each arm gives
  the join one of the boxes). Simplify gives the join the number
  that was unboxed. Where a handler begins by unboxing its
  parameter, the unboxing of parameters gives, for an argument that
  a `Let` in scope has unboxed, the variable of that `Let`
  (`FlambdaUnboxParamsSpec.projection_of`, with
  `FlambdaCseSpec.computed_by`; T6's).
- A result that nothing uses, of a test that has a call in one of
  its branches (`ignored_call_or_constant.ml`,
  `ignored_two_calls.ml`, `ignored_call_of_three.ml`,
  `ignored_second_of_pair.ml`, `two_ignored_tests.ml`,
  `nested_ignored_tests.ml`; the source is `let _ = if c then f x
  else 8 in ...`). Simplify removes the parameter of the
  continuation after the test. A call gives its return continuation
  all its results, so the call then returns to a new continuation,
  bound at the call, that applies the old one to what is left. The
  removal of unused parameters stopped at a continuation that a
  call returns to. A round of the term before now ends by removing
  such a parameter and binding, at each call that returns there, a
  wrapper that drops the result
  (`FlambdaWrapReturnsSpec.wrap_returns`, N3's), where the
  continuation is not an exception handler and is applied or
  returned to twice at least.
- The rewrites that Simplify makes from the types (above), in a
  term in which something was lifted. They were applied in the
  normalisation of the term before only, and a term in which
  something was lifted is normalised from the term as it was read,
  so it had none of them. It now has them once too, between its
  rounds (`FlambdaValidateSpec.normalise_lifted`, T2's).
  `local_closure_applied_mutual.ml` and
  `toplevel_closure_applied_mutual.ml`, which were validated at the
  second asking, are validated at the first; no unit of this
  directory was stopped by it alone.
- A match that Simplify makes a table of (`match_constant_table.ml`,
  `match_int_dense.ml`, `match_int_intervals.ml`,
  `match_tuple_of_variants.ml`). The arms of a `Switch` give one
  continuation constants that follow no rule. Simplify binds the
  constants to a static immutable array and makes the `Switch` a
  load from it at the scrutinee. The validation does it in two
  halves. A lifting may name tables, each a symbol with the
  elements of an immutable array, and the validation binds them in
  one group at the head of the term before
  (`FlambdaUnusedHeadStaticsSpec.add_head_tables`), only where two
  checks pass: every element of every table is a constant or a
  symbol (`tables_plain`), and the removal of exactly those symbols
  is permitted of the term with the group
  (`head_statics_removable`). The unit with the group refines the
  unit without it, each run on its own
  (`add_head_tables_program_refines_statement`). The tool names, in
  its first lifting, the symbols that the term after binds outside
  code to such an array and uses, and that the term before does not
  bind. Then a round of the first phase of the term before makes a
  `Switch` whose arms all give one continuation the elements of a
  table that is in scope, in the order of the arms, the load from
  that table at the scrutinee
  (`FlambdaMergeTablesSpec.merge_tables`, T1's). Only a table of
  values is one there: the model has no static array of naked
  numbers. The line of the verdict says "the tables of the term
  after bound in the term before".
- A boolean that Simplify keeps untagged in a parameter of a loop
  (`while_flag.ml`, and seven units that came with the rewrites:
  `flag_set_in_loop.ml`, `flag_set_in_loop_first.ml`,
  `two_flags_set_in_loop.ml`, `flag_and_count_in_loop.ml`,
  `while_flag_then_test.ml`, `while_stop_flag.ml`,
  `while_flag_toplevel.ml`). A flag kept in a reference and set in
  a loop is a parameter of the loop and of the continuations around
  it, and Simplify makes it a naked immediate in all of them. A
  round of the first phase of the term before untags, where they
  are given, the parameters that hold a tagged immediate and are
  only untagged or passed on, in all the continuations that pass
  them at once (`FlambdaUntagParamsSpec.untag_params`, N3's). Where
  a loop goes on while the flag is not set, Simplify gives the
  continuation that the two arms of the test of the flag come to a
  parameter which each arm gives the number of the arm. The
  tidying that follows the placing of continuations makes each such
  number the scrutinee and takes the parameter away, in both terms
  (`FlambdaGiveScrutineeSpec.give_scrutinees`, then
  `FlambdaUnaliasParamsSpec.unalias_params`; N3's).
- A parameter of a join that is read in two places
  (`option_matched_twice.ml`, `two_options_matched.ml`,
  `option_in_pair.ml`): an option made on the two arms of a test
  and matched twice after they meet, so that the test of the option
  and the load of its contents are each made in two places. After
  Simplify the join has one parameter for each thing read, where
  the unboxing of the term before made one for each place. Where
  it makes a read of a parameter a parameter, the other `Let`s of
  the handler that read the same parameter by the same primitive
  now become `Let`s of the variable of the read
  (`FlambdaUnboxVariantsSpec.with_reads_shared`, T6's). Loads are
  shared only where the tags that are known for them do not
  differ.
- A loop that is given a box made at every turn
  (`int64_sum_in_loop.ml`, `pair_turned_in_loop.ml`,
  `pair_loop_in_loop.ml`): a reference that holds a boxed number or
  a pair, entered with a constant and set at every turn. After
  Simplify the loop has the number, or the fields, for parameters.
  A round of the first phase of the term before makes a read of a
  parameter of a loop, which its handler comes to before any test,
  a parameter, where the entry and every turn give something that
  the term shows (`FlambdaUnboxLoopsSpec.unbox_loops_knowing`,
  T6's).
- A call that returns to a continuation which ends a region and
  passes the result on (`stack_argument_result_returned.ml`, X5's
  source: a function allocates a pair on its stack, gives it to
  another function and returns what that one returns). The
  conversion drops regions, so in the model the handler only passes
  its parameter on; for Simplify it ends a region, and the term
  after has the call returning to it. The rounds of the term before
  made such a call return to the continuation that the handler
  applies, and the term after cannot be given the same. The calls
  of the term before are now taken on when its rounds are over
  (`FlambdaValidateSpec.with_returns`), and left where the term
  after, normalised and tidied, keeps a call that returns so
  (`keeps_a_return`; V4's). The unit was validated before the
  forwarding of applications took a call on, and is again.
- Local functions that call each other, each given to a function
  that is inlined (`fun_local_mutual_to_inlined.ml`,
  `kept_local_mutual_to_inlined.ml`,
  `fct_local_mutual_both_to_inlined.ml`,
  `loop_local_mutual_both_in_loop.ml`,
  `match_local_mutual_both_in_arm.ml`,
  `two_local_mutual_both_in_inner_function.ml`,
  `fun_local_three_mutual_to_inlined.ml`, `nomark_local_mutual.ml`;
  sources by T3). In the code of the function around them the first
  asking makes the call of the first direct; the second is reached
  by a projection of its function slot from the first, and that
  call is left where the term after has a direct call. Each is
  validated at the second asking, which follows aliases in the
  bodies of code knowing what the symbols are bound to
  (`FlambdaValidateKnowingSpec.follow_aliases_knowing`). They are
  the units of this directory that are validated at the second
  asking. By a measure of T3's with the tool of fda8114815, over
  4,166 terms (the units of this directory at two settings of the
  flags, and sets that are not in this tree), 66 are validated at
  the second asking, 10 of them only with the part that follows
  aliases in the bodies of code; nothing in the tree makes the
  measure.

A count over 600 units made at random is in `census/README.md`, with
one over 240 more that have exceptions, loops and recursive functions.

## Units that test the arithmetic

Some units have no unknown input: Simplify computes the whole result,
and the machine computes it from the term before, so the two runs
agreeing says that the model's primitives and Simplify's compute the
same thing there. They are written for the edges: arithmetic that
overflows at 63, 32 and 64 bits (`overflow_wrap.ml`,
`int32_overflow.ml`, `int64_overflow.ml`), shifts at the first and the
last bit (`shift_edges.ml`), conversions that lose bits or extend a
sign (`conv_truncate.ml`), comparisons of negative numbers
(`compare_signed.ml`). Each result is exported by itself and not in a
tuple, as a tuple of constants is made a symbol and the unit would
then wait for lifting.

## What a check costs

The tool gives the validator fifty rounds. A round applies each
normalisation once to the whole term, and the normalisations are at
worst quadratic in the size of the term; the rounds are there because
one rewrite makes room for another, and most units are done in three or
four: a run of rounds stops after the first one that gives back the
term it was given, up to bound names (`FlambdaValidateSpec.iterate`).
A round inlines every direct call of known code but for the code
that the tool names to the validator, a guess that is not trusted. The
tool tries two lists in turn: the code that is recursive (that calls
itself, at once or through other code, in either term) with the code
that the term after still calls directly; then the recursive code
alone. Without such a list each round unrolled a recursive function
once more on both sides, and `fib.ml` did not end. With it a round can
only inline code that is not recursive, so the terms stop growing.
Each attempt may go on to guess what Simplify lifted, in four
liftings at most, and which value slots it removed, and where it
fails it is made again at the second asking. The 370 units here
were checked in 6.6 seconds of processor time together in one run
(2.5 user, 4.1 system), and in 11.8 in a second run of the same
tool, made while other builds ran on the machine (3.6 and 8.3):
more than half of each is the system's part, and it is that part
which differs most. The 347 units that the directory had at
87cdbf3e01 took 47
seconds with the tool of that commit, 28 of them for the four units
with a match that Simplify makes a table of. Two things have come
since, each measured with the tool before it and the tool after it
on the tree of the change. The four units are validated by the load
from a table (above): 26 to 28 seconds for the four before, less
than one after. And a run of rounds stops, where it made all its
fifty rounds whatever the term: the 358 units that the directory
then had took 20.6 seconds before and 7.4 after. Neither changed
what the tool prints of a unit that the directory had, but for the
four. `census/README.md` has the times of the generated units.

`FLSEMANTICS_PRINT_TERMS=1` makes the tool print, of a unit that is not
validated, two terms that the validation compared, for each list, and
how the term before was made: it is not always the last pair that was
compared.

## What a validation does not say

- A unit is validated on the reading that a string is immutable.
  `Bytes.unsafe_to_string`, `Bytes.unsafe_of_string` and the
  conversions between arrays and immutable arrays are erased before
  Flambda 2 (`from_lambda/lambda_to_lambda_transforms.ml`), so the test
  tool cannot see them; it refuses a unit in which a primitive on bytes
  arrives, but the verdict on a unit that reads a string says nothing
  of a string that is the block of bytes written while it is read
  (X5-3).
- Regions: see above.
- What is validated is the term the parser reads back from what
  `-drawfexpr` prints (see "validated" above), as the tool's Simplify
  simplifies it. The printed term has no mark for a functor, for
  `[@cold]`, for opaque code or for the modes of parameters, and the
  parser gives each a default
  (`middle_end/flambda2/parser/fexpr_to_flambda.ml`); for the modes
  of parameters the tool puts the least that can be said in the
  place of the default (below, with X5-11). Simplify reads
  them. So the tool's Simplify can decide otherwise than the
  compiler's on the same unit. One case is known. For code with no
  inlining attribute, the decision made at its declaration
  (`make_decision0` of
  `middle_end/flambda2/simplify_shared/function_decl_inlining_decision.ml`)
  compares the size of the code with the thresholds for functors
  (`small_functor_size`, `large_functor_size`) if the code is marked
  as a functor, and with those for functions if not; a functor no
  larger than `small_functor_size` is to be inlined. The tool's
  Simplify, to which the functor is a function, compares it with
  the thresholds for functions and may leave the call. The pair
  validated is then not the pair that the compiler made (discrepancy
  V2-6). For code with `[@inline]` or `[@inline never]` that
  decision does not look at the mark of a functor; the other marks
  are lost for such code as for any other.
- The printed term loses kinds and marks as well (found by X5, who
  compared the term in the compiler's memory with the term read
  back; nothing in the tree makes that comparison). Four of the
  losses are of something that Simplify reads, and with each the
  tool's Simplify knows less than the compiler's:
  - the kind of the result of an application, where the arity of the
    result is not written: the subkind is lost and the result is read
    as one that may be null, and the type of the result of a call
    that is not inlined comes from that arity where nothing more
    precise is known of the result (`T.unknown_types_from_arity` in
    `middle_end/flambda2/simplify/simplify_apply_expr.ml`);
    `identity.ml` has it;
  - the kinds of the fields of a `Make_block`, whose subkinds are
    lost (discrepancy V2-2): Simplify meets the type of each argument
    that is a variable with the kind of its field
    (`simplify_make_block` in
    `middle_end/flambda2/simplify/simplify_variadic_primitive.ml`);
    `exported_list.ml`;
  - the mark `[cold]` of a continuation handler, such as the handler
    of a failed bounds check, which is dropped (`DE.mark_as_cold` in
    `middle_end/flambda2/simplify/simplify_let_cont_expr.ml`);
    `string_get_checked.ml`;
  - debugging information (discrepancy X5-10). The fields of a
    static block carry it (`Simple.With_debuginfo.t`, in
    `middle_end/flambda2/terms/static_const.ml`); the order on static
    constants compares it; and the constants that may be shared are
    looked up by that order (`find_shareable_constant` in
    `middle_end/flambda2/simplify/env/downwards_acc.ml`, asked by
    `lift` in `middle_end/flambda2/simplify/lifting/reification.ml`).
    A block that Simplify lifts has the debugging information of its
    allocation on each field, a constant that the front end makes
    has none, and the text of terms has none at all. So the tool's
    Simplify shares a lifted block with an equal constant that the
    unit binds already, where the compiler's makes a second symbol.
    No unit of this directory changes verdict by it; three generated
    units did (`census/README.md`).

  One more loss is of something that Simplify does not read: whether
  a value slot always holds an immediate, which the parser reads as
  false (`add3_exported.ml`). The kind of the slot is kept.
  `middle_end/flambda2/to_cmm/to_cmm_set_of_closures.ml` reads the
  mark, and the tool does not run that pass.

  With one more the tool's Simplify is told more than the compiler's:
  a value that may be null is read as one that never is, wherever the
  text writes its kind. That is discrepancy T4-13, and the 14 units
  that have such a kind are counted apart (see "What the verdicts
  mean"). None of these losses makes a verdict wrong of the pair that
  the tool validates: they are a distance between that pair and the
  compiler's.

  With one more still the reader says more than the compiler's term
  does, and the tool takes it back before its Simplify runs. The
  text has no modes for the parameters of code, and the reader gives
  every parameter the mode of a value on the heap (`param_modes` in
  `middle_end/flambda2/parser/fexpr_to_flambda.ml`). Simplify, run on
  a term read so, can prove that a parameter which may be on the
  stack is a block of the heap, and return that block where the
  compiler makes a copy of it on the heap (discrepancy X5-11). The
  compiler, which does not read its terms from text, is not
  affected. It was seen on a unit that is not in the tree (by X5;
  nothing in the tree reproduces it): compiled through the text,
  the program read a block of the stack that a later call had
  written over, and compiled directly it was right. So the tool
  gives every parameter of every piece of code that the unit binds
  the least that the compiler can say of where a value is
  (`Alloc_mode.For_types.unknown ()`: heap or stack, and heap in a
  compiler configured without stack allocation, where nothing is on
  the stack), before anything else is done with the unit
  (`with_unknown_param_modes` in
  `middle_end/flambda2/tests/tools/flsemantics.ml`). Of where a
  parameter of that code is, the modes then tell the tool's Simplify
  no more than those of the compiler's term tell the compiler's,
  and less where the compiler's term says heap and the compiler
  allocates on the stack: a loss like those above, a distance and
  not an error. That is of these modes only.
  What else the reader gives a default for stays as the reader gives
  it (the marks named above), and code of another unit, which
  Simplify reads from a `.cmx` file, has the modes that the compiler
  wrote there. No verdict rests on the reader's mode heap for a
  parameter of code that the unit binds, and no unit is counted
  apart for it. In the compiler's own term (`param_modes` in what
  `-drawflambda` prints) 20 of the 331 units that this directory
  had when the tool was changed have a parameter whose mode is not
  heap, each of them heap or stack: `curry`, `inline_record`,
  `labelled_optional`, `let_polymorphism`, `list_head`,
  `list_length`, `list_map`, `list_sum`, `match_guard`,
  `match_variant_local`, `nested_record`, `nested_tuple`,
  `option_bind`, `option_map`, `polymorphic_variant`,
  `project_record_two_levels`, `record_update`, `result_map`,
  `same_field_chain_twice` and `tree_root`. Of the 39 units
  that have entered since, one has: `stack_argument_result_returned`,
  whose source says `local_` of a parameter, the first source of
  this directory that does. Each unit is looked at so before it
  enters. What was run for the
  change of the tool: the tests of this directory before and after
  it, in which no expected file has another verdict or another
  count of steps, those of the 20 units among them (two files have
  other names of variables in the message of a primitive that the
  model has not got, as the unit is built again with fresh names
  for what it binds); and the tool on the 840 generated units of
  `census/` before and after it, which have the verdicts they had.

  The model erases the regions of allocation and their lifetimes
  (the conversion makes of a local allocation one on the heap,
  discrepancy V2-3): equal outcomes of the two runs, or a
  validation, whether plain or counted apart, do not establish that
  a block which is returned is still alive.
- Of a primitive the text loses two more things. It does not write
  the kind of an `Opaque_identity`, and the reader gives every one
  the kind of values. The tool gives each the kind of its argument,
  as the reader has it, before anything else is done with a unit
  read from a text (`with_opaque_kinds` in
  `middle_end/flambda2/tests/tools/flsemantics.ml`; discrepancy
  C2-27). That is the kind which the compiler's term had on two
  conditions: the kind that the reader has for the argument is the
  kind of that argument in the compiler's term, and the primitive
  there had the kind of its argument. Nothing checks either;
  without those conditions this step makes no claim to recover the
  compiler's kind. By C2's count of what
  `-drawflambda` prints, which nothing in the tree makes, every
  `Opaque_identity` of the 347 units that the directory had at
  87cdbf3e01 is of a value; the tool with this step prints of each
  of them what it printed without it. And the text writes the two
  tests of being an integer
  alike, the one that is for variants and the one that is for any
  value (`Is_int_generic` in what `-drawflambda` prints); the reader
  gives the one for variants. On a value that is not a variant, a
  closure for one, the term read is then undefined in the model
  where the program answers 0 (discrepancy C2-26). The tool does
  not put that right. No unit of this directory has the test that
  is for any value, and `from_ocaml.sh` fails on a unit that has it
  and that `generic_is_int.txt` does not name; that list is empty.
- Two things that the tool refuses, to stay clear of two ways in
  which the term of the model may not be the program. Neither
  refusal shows that it is not: each refuses more than it need. A
  binding whose variables are phantom, which Simplify may keep with
  `-g` where it would delete an unused binding, and which the
  program does not run: the conversion refuses it, where it
  converted it as a `Let` that the model runs (discrepancy C2-19;
  `pairs/README.md` has a pair). A body taken from a `.cmx` that
  has one is left out of the prefix, and a unit whose term after
  has one is not checked. The text does not say that mode, so the
  refusal does not see a phantom binding in a term read from a
  text. And a unit of which, as either term is written, some use of
  the return continuation gives it something else than the symbol
  of the unit, or to which a call returns: other units read the
  data of that symbol, and the model observes what the unit gives
  its return continuation (discrepancy C2-21). It is a test of the
  form of the term: a unit that gives the continuation its own
  symbol through a variable, or from a call, fails it. No unit of
  this directory fails it.
- That distance has been measured for the units of this directory
  (by X5, with the tool and the 259 units as they are at ba85db2822;
  nothing in the tree makes the measure). The check of the tool was
  given the two terms of the compiler's own run as they are in its
  memory: the term given to Simplify and the term that the compiler's
  Simplify returned, taken through the two hooks of
  `driver/compiler_hooks.mli` (`Raw_flambda2`, `Flambda2`), with no
  text written or read and no second run of Simplify. The conversion
  was the tool's with one change: the kinds of the fields of a
  `Make_block` were dropped, as the text drops them. (As it stands,
  `convert_variadic_primitive` of
  `middle_end/flambda2/tests/tools/flsemantics.ml` takes only fields
  of any value; of the terms in memory it refuses 58 of the 259
  units, for a subkind in 51 and for a field that is only never null
  in 7; 57 of the 58 are converted with the change.) What follows is
  what the check answers with that changed conversion, which is in no
  tree. It is no proof that dropping those kinds is faithful, and the
  change is not made to the tool, which refuses such a block on
  purpose: Simplify takes an argument that is a variable to be of
  the subkind of its field, and makes the primitive `Invalid` where
  it cannot be (the comment of `convert_variadic_primitive`). At the
  default flags, of the 259 units:
  - 252 are converted in both ways, and for each of them the tool
    prints of the compiler's pair the lines that it prints of its
    own: the verdict, the comparison that succeeded, the steps of
    the two runs, the check of kinds. 242 are validated, 8 are not,
    2 are undefined before Simplify.
  - 5 are refused by the conversion in both ways.
  - 2 are validated of the tool's pair, and of the compiler's pair
    the term after Simplify is not well-formed: `div_unknown.ml` and
    `string_get16_checked.ml`. The compiler's Simplify keeps the
    handler of the raise, which the front end marks `[cold]`, as a
    handler of its own (`add_non_inlinable_continuation` in
    `middle_end/flambda2/simplify/env/upwards_env.ml` keeps the
    handler of a cold continuation unknown to its uses). The binding
    of the module block is then in a handler whose body can leave
    through another continuation, which
    `FlambdaWellFormedSpec.statics_at_toplevel` refuses, and which
    Simplify refuses too when it is given its own output
    (discrepancy X5-9, a second shape of C5-11). The tool's
    Simplify, to which the handler is not cold, puts the raise in
    the arm of the `Switch`, and the tool validates that term.

  With `-O3`: 228 validated, 22 not, 2 undefined before, the same 5
  and the same 2, and again the same lines for all 252.

  The two terms after Simplify, as `-dfexpr-to` writes them, compared
  as texts up to names, are the same for 253 of the 259 units (252
  with `-O3`). The others are the two above and units in which only a
  kind that is written differs (`call_result_tested.ml`,
  `partial_exported.ml`, `tupled_recursive.ml`,
  `tupled_unknown_pair.ml`; with `-O3`,
  `exported_funs_in_arms_used.ml` and `returned_closure_of_pair.ml`
  in place of the first).

  For the 13 units of T4-13 that the directory had then, with both
  sets of flags, the two terms
  after Simplify as printed are the same up to names, and with the
  changed conversion the check prints the same lines of the
  compiler's pair as of the tool's. The comparison of the terms is
  of texts: it does not compare the kinds and the marks that the
  text does not write. Nothing is claimed of dropping the kinds of
  fields. The 13 stay counted apart: the measure is not made in the
  tree, and is of the units and the tool of that commit. The
  fourteenth unit of T4-13 is not among the 259.

What no example here validates, because the model has not got it:
mutable fields and arrays, arithmetic on floats, calls of C functions
(polymorphic comparison among them), an exception that the unit
declares (it is made by a call of a C function), objects, laziness.
(`fst` and `snd` are in the model: the standard library declares them
with `%field0_immut` and `%field1_immut`, a load that cannot change,
with a tag and a size that are not known: `fst_snd.ml`. It is `!`, and
`%field0` written by hand, that load a field marked as one that may
change.)

## The compiler's own run

`../../tools/ownrun/flsemantics_ownrun.ml` is a second way to check a
unit, beside the first and not in its place: every count in this file,
but those of this section, is of the first.

    sh own_run.sh <flsemantics_ownrun.exe> X.ml

which is, in a directory of its own,

    flsemantics_ownrun.exe -nopervasives -nostdlib -stop-after middle_end \
      -c [X.mli] X.ml

The program is the compiler: its driver (`driver/oxcaml_main.ml`) with
two hooks registered (`driver/compiler_hooks.mli`). The hook
`Raw_flambda2` is given the term that the compiler gives to Simplify,
and the hook `Flambda2` the term that the compiler's own Simplify
returned (`flambda_to_flambda0` in `middle_end/flambda2/flambda2.ml`).
The two terms are given, as they are in memory, to the check of the
tool (`Flsemantics.check`), which prints what it prints in the first
way, under the name `X.fl`.

It differs from the first way in three things:

- No text. The first way checks the term that the reader makes of
  `X.fl`, the text that `-drawfexpr` printed. Here the term before is
  the one in the compiler's memory, which has what the text does not
  write ("What a validation does not say"). The test made of the text
  for a call of unknown arity whose result is not one value
  (`result_arity_lost`) is not made: the term has the arity. Nor is
  the term changed as a term read from a text is before it is checked
  (`as_read_from_text`, which gives each `Opaque_identity` the kind
  of its argument and every parameter of code the mode unknown): the
  term in memory has its kinds and its modes.
- No second Simplify. The first way runs Simplify itself on the term
  read. Here the term after is the one that the compiler's Simplify
  returned, in the compilation that made the term before.
- The load path. The first way looks for the `.cmx` files of other
  units only in the directories given by `-I` (`init_load_path`). The
  program has the compiler's load path (`Compmisc.init_path`): the
  current directory unless `-nocwd` is given, the directories of `-I`
  and `-H`, and the standard library unless `-nostdlib` is given.
  `own_run.sh` gives `-nostdlib` and no `-I`, and runs the program in
  a directory that has only the unit. So the rule of a unit of this
  directory finds no `.cmx` file of another unit, where nothing else
  adds to the compiler's load path (`OCAMLPARAM`); a run by hand
  reads what the compiler would read.

The rest is the first way's, the same code and the same extracted
model: the conversion, the test that the term before is well-formed,
the two runs and their comparison, the validator, and the units asked
about (those whose `.cmx` file the compilation has read).

So a verdict printed in this way is of the pair that the compiler
made: of two terms, as a verdict of the first way is, with the same
labels and the theorems that those labels have. Like a verdict of the
first way it rests on the conversion. It does not rest on the
printer, on the reader or on the tool's run of Simplify being the
compiler's; in their place it rests on the two hooks being given the
terms that the compiler goes on with. What a verdict of the first way
does not say ("What a validation does not say"), this one does not
say either, but for the losses of the text. And it says nothing of
what the compiler then makes of the term after: the reaper, where
that is enabled, the translation to Cmm, the back end and the link
are not looked at. Of a unit on which the compiler does not run
Simplify (`-Oclassic`, or an attribute of the unit) the program says
"not checked".

What it finds of the 347 units of this directory at 87cdbf3e01. It
was measured with the program of this section on the tree at that
commit, at the default flags; no `X.own_expected` is in the tree, so
no rule of the tree makes the measure again. The units of `pairs/`
are not run: `own_run.sh` does not give the program the `.cmx` file
of a first unit.

- Of the 325 units that the first way validates at that commit (283,
  the 14 counted apart for T4-13 and 28 with their imports, by the
  tables that this file has there), this one validates 241 and says
  "not checked" of 78, for one clause of the conversion. Of a
  `Make_block` it takes only
  fields of any value (in `convert_variadic_primitive` of
  `../../tools/flsemantics.ml`, the test that the kind of each field is
  `Flambda_kind.With_subkind.any_value`), and the term in memory has
  the kinds of the fields, which the text has not. With that clause
  changed to ask only that each field is a value, a change that is in
  no tree and of which nothing is proved, it validates 319 of the 325,
  and no unit that the first way does not.
  `empty_array_phys_equal.ml`, whose run is undefined in the model in
  both ways, is not among the 325, and prints in this way what it
  prints in the first.
- The 6 others have the handler of a failed check (of a divisor, of an
  index), which the front end marks `[cold]`; the text does not carry
  the mark. The compiler's Simplify keeps a cold handler as a handler
  of its own; the tool's, to which it is not cold, puts the raise in
  the arm of the `Switch`. Of `div_unknown.ml`,
  `string_get16_checked.ml` and `string_get_twice.ml` the compiler's
  term after then binds the module block in a handler whose body can
  leave through another continuation, and is not well-formed
  (discrepancy X5-9, above): the program exits 1, as the tool does of
  such a term, so these three can have no `X.own_expected` as long as
  that stands. Of `string_get_in_branch.ml`,
  `string_get_two_indices.ml` and `string_length_after_join.ml` the
  two runs agree, and the validator does not accept the pair in which
  the handler is kept: "not validated".

A unit that has `X.own_expected` beside it is checked in this way by
the rules of this directory, which compare what the program prints
with that file; a unit that has none is checked in the first way
only.

The program checks one unit in a process, as the tool does. Given a
second, it says of it "not checked: a second unit in one process",
checks nothing from then on, and exits with 2; `../own_run/` has a
control of that, in which the compiler does not run Simplify on the
first unit.
