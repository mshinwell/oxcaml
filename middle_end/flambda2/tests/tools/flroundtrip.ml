(* A check of the conversion of flsemantics.ml, which is trusted: a round trip
   through fexpr.

   The unit of an [.fl] file is converted to a term of the Rocq model. That term
   is written back as fexpr (flmodel_to_fexpr.ml), the text is read again by the
   compiler's parser, and the unit read is converted in its turn, with the names
   numbered afresh. The two terms of the model should be the same. They are
   compared by the model's own comparison (FlambdaCompareSpec.expr_eqb), which
   is up to the names of bound variables and continuations and asks symbols,
   code ids and slots to be the same; so the symbols, code ids and slots of the
   second term are first given the numbers they had in the first, which are read
   off the names that the printer gave them. A name is read as a number only if
   it is exactly what the printer makes of that number. And the value slots of
   each set of closures are put, in both terms, in the order of their numbers
   ([slots_in_order] says why).

   The same is done of the unit that Simplify makes of the one in the file,
   whose conversion is trusted as much, and which has what the parser of fexpr
   never makes of a file: so it is there that the limits of fexpr show.

   One answer is printed for the unit of the file, and one for the unit after
   Simplify: - "round trip the same"; - "round trip DIFFERS", with the first
   line at which the two terms, printed, differ. This is a mistake of the
   conversion or of the printer, something that the conversion drops and should
   not, or something that fexpr writes and its parser reads differently; - "not
   printable", with the reason: the term has something that fexpr cannot write,
   or that the printer does not cover; - "not read back": the compiler's parser,
   or its conversion of fexpr to Flambda, fails on the text printed; - "names
   not read back", with the reason: the term read back uses a symbol, a code id
   or a slot whose name is not one that the printer makes, or two of them have
   one name or one number. This is a mistake of the printer or of the
   conversion; - "not converted", with the reason: the unit of the file has
   something that the model has not got; "not converted back" is the same of the
   unit read back, and is a mistake of the printer.

   What this does not check: the kinds of the value slots, which are not in the
   term; the order of the value slots of a set of closures, which the text
   cannot keep; what the conversion does to the two units of a check together
   (the numbers it gives the code ids of the unit after: flsemantics.ml,
   [convert_both]); and what the conversion drops, when the printer puts nothing
   in its place: a mistake by which both terms lack the same thing is not seen.
   So it is a check that what the conversion makes of each example is stable
   under this round trip, in which the printer is a second reading of the model.
   It does not show that the conversion is one to one (a conversion that takes
   two things to one, with a printer that writes one of them, passes) nor that
   it keeps enough.

   This module does not know the conversion, nor how Simplify is run:
   flsemantics.ml gives both as functions. *)

(* ---- The value slots of a set, in the order of their numbers ----------- *)

(* The model keeps the value slots of a set of closures as a list, in the order
   of the compiler's map of value slots, which is the order in which the
   compiler made the slots (flsemantics.ml, [convert_value_slots]). The text
   cannot keep that order: the parser of fexpr makes a slot where the text first
   names it, and that may be in the code of a function, before the set, where
   the code projects some of the slots and not others. The machine looks a slot
   up by its name, and what a lookup finds does not depend on where the slot
   stands among the others (two bindings of one slot keep their order here: the
   sort is stable). So the two terms are compared with the slots of each set in
   the order of their numbers; what each slot holds is compared as before.

   This is a choice of what the round trip tells apart, and no proof that two
   such terms are equivalent: a closure that is a value still holds its slots as
   a list, in the order of the term, and a value that a unit returns shows
   it. *)
