(* A term of the Rocq model of Flambda 2
   (middle_end/flambda2/rocq/FlambdaModel.v) written back as fexpr.

   This is the other direction of the conversion of flsemantics.ml, and it is
   written from the model and from the syntax of fexpr, not from that
   conversion: what a term of the model means is read off FlambdaModel.v and
   FlambdaPrimitiveModel.v, and the Flambda term that means the same is written
   down. The two are then checked against each other (flroundtrip.ml): a unit
   converted to the model, written back here, read again by the compiler's
   parser and converted again should be the term of the model it was.

   The result is a function of the term, of the two continuations of its unit,
   and of the kinds of the value slots, which the model keeps beside the term.
   Names are made from the numbers of the model: a variable [v12], a
   continuation [k3], a code id [code7], a value slot [vs2], a function slot
   [fs1], a symbol [$s5]. The two continuations of the unit are [done] and
   [error].

   What the model has not got is given the value that says least: no
   continuation sort but that of an exception handler, no inlining attribute,
   size 0 for code, code that is neither recursive nor a stub nor tupled,
   allocation on the heap, no subkinds. Code gets a region variable and a depth
   variable of its own, as the syntax asks for them; a call or an allocation in
   code names that region.

   What is covered: the terms that the conversion makes today. A term that is
   outside them, or that fexpr has no way to write, raises [Not_printable] with
   the reason: - an arity with an unboxed product: an arity of fexpr is a list
   of kinds; - a constant that is a vector, a mask or poison, which the
   conversion does not make; - a primitive of the heap, which the conversion
   does not make either; - [Closure_of_set] other than as
   FlambdaModel.let_closures makes it: the closure at the first function slot of
   its set, followed by the projections of the other function slots, in order,
   each bound at kind [Value]. Flambda binds all the closures of a set at once;
   - [Static_const_closure_of_set] other than as FlambdaModel.bind_closures
   makes it: the closures of one static set next to each other, in the order of
   the set's symbols, of which there is at least one; - a closure bound at
   another kind than [Value]; - code whose parameters are not as many as the
   kinds of its arity; - a static boxed number whose contents are not a number
   that can be boxed, or are a variable whose binder is not in sight (the model
   does not say which number a boxed number holds; it is read off the kind of
   the variable); - a value slot of kind [Region] or [Rec_info].

   What fexpr can write and its parser reads differently is written all the
   same, so that the check shows it: the arity of the arguments of a direct
   call, the flag of [Is_int], the kind of [Opaque_identity]. *)
