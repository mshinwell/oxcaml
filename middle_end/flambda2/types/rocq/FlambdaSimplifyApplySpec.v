(* Simplifying a call from the type of its callee: an indirect call
   becomes a direct call.

   This file is to be reviewed: the definitions and the statements,
   against middle_end/flambda2/simplify/simplify_apply_expr.ml
   ([simplify_apply_shared], [simplify_function_call],
   [simplify_direct_function_call]) and, for the type of a closure
   that is made, simplify_set_of_closures.ml. Refinement relative to a
   typing environment is FlambdaTypingEnvRefinementSpec.v; the type of
   an argument and the function that computes it are
   FlambdaSimplifyPrimitivesSpec.v; the provers and what their answers
   mean are FlambdaProvers.v and FlambdaProversSpec.v; what a call
   does is ../../rocq/FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v ([call_function]).

   What Simplify does at an [Apply] of an OCaml function.
   - [simplify_apply_shared] replaces the callee and the arguments by
     their canonical elements ([Simplify_simple.simplify_simple]), and
     makes the call [Invalid] where the type of an argument is not of
     the kind that the arity of the call gives it.
   - [simplify_function_call] asks
     [Provers.meet_single_closures_entry] of the type of the callee.
     - Where it answers an entry, and the environment has the
       metadata of the code id of the function type of the entry
       ([find_code_metadata_exn]; if it has not, the call is treated
       as one of whose callee nothing is known), that code is the
       code that the call runs, and [simplify_direct_function_call]
       makes the call a direct call
       ([Call_kind.direct_function_call]). Where the call names code
       already (a direct call, or an indirect call of known arity
       that lists code ids), the code ids are met with the one of
       the type in the code age relation: the call is [Invalid] if
       the meet is bottom; the code id of the meet is taken if it is
       one code id whose metadata the environment has, and the code
       id of the type otherwise. Then the call of a tupled function
       is adapted to the calling convention of its code, the
       arities of the call and of the code are compared, an
       over-application is split, a partial application is made a
       closure, and it is decided whether to inline.
     - Where it answers that the type has no closure, the call
       becomes [Invalid].
     - Where it answers neither, the call is left; but an indirect
       call of unknown arity whose callee is, by
       [Provers.meet_code_ids], among pieces of code that are not
       tupled and all have the arity of the call is marked as an
       indirect call of known arity with those code ids.

   What is here: the canonical elements, and the step from an entry
   to the direct call, for a call that is indirect. Not here: the
   rejection of a call on the kinds of its arguments; the metadata of
   the code (the model's environments have none: the code id answered
   is used as it is); the code age relation, and so the calls that
   name code already; the calling convention of tupled functions;
   the arities, over-application and partial application; inlining;
   the mark of an indirect call of known arity, a call kind that the
   model has not; the answer that the type has no closure.

   The statements.
   - From the type to the code ([callee_code_proved_statement]). In a
     state that satisfies the environment strictly, if
     [Provers.prove_single_closures_entry] proves an entry of the type
     of the callee, the value of the callee is a closure whose code is
     the code id of the function type answered.
   - So the indirect call is equivalent to the direct call of that
     code ([apply_direct_proved_statement]). That an indirect call of
     a closure of known code is the direct call of the code is
     [apply_indirect_known_statement] of
     ../../rocq/FlambdaApplySpec.v; this is the step from the type to
     "known".
   - The callee and the arguments may be replaced by their canonical
     elements ([apply_canonical_statement]).
   - One function that does both, [simplify_apply], for the function
     that assembles the rewrites from the types
     (FlambdaSimplifyPassSpec.v, which leaves a call as it is today).
     What it answers is equivalent to the call under the environment,
     with no premise ([simplify_apply_equivalent_under_statement]),
     and it commutes with renaming ([simplify_apply_rename_statement]).
   - The type of a closure that is made ([closure_of_set_type],
     [set_of_closures_type]): the closure at its function slot of a
     set that has exactly the functions of the defining expression,
     each of the code named, and its value slots, each of the type of
     its [Simple]. The value of the defining expression has that type
     ([closure_of_set_typed_statement],
     [set_of_closures_typed_statement]), so the body of its [Let] may
     be rewritten under the environment in which the variable has it
     ([let_closure_of_set_statement], [let_set_of_closures_statement]).
     Its variables are those of the types of the value slots, and it
     is renamed by renaming them
     ([closure_of_set_type_free_variables_statement],
     [closure_of_set_type_rename_statement]): what the function that
     assembles the rewrites needs of a type that it gives a variable.
     Simplify gives more: the types of the closures of the set (each
     an alias of the name that the closure is bound to), and the mode
     of the allocation.
   - Three small terms, from OCaml functions, rewritten with these
     from the environment that knows only the parameter: a local
     function called through its variable
     ([example_local_function_statement]), a closure read from a pair
     ([example_closure_from_pair_statement]), and a function that is
     the argument of an inlined call
     ([example_function_argument_statement]). In each the prover
     proves the entry of the type that the closure was given, and the
     call that the function answers is the direct call. The terms are
     written by hand after what the compiler makes of the functions;
     none was taken from a run of it.

   The prover asked. Simplify asks the meet shortcut
   [Provers.meet_single_closures_entry]; the statements here are of
   [Provers.prove_single_closures_entry], which reads the type in the
   same way and answers [Proved] on fewer types: not on a type that
   has values that are not closures (a closure or null). With
   [Proved], every value of the type is a closure of the code, and
   the equivalence follows from [apply_indirect_known_statement]
   alone, whatever a call does of a callee that is not a closure.
   With the shortcut's answers (an entry, or no closure) one needs
   besides that a call whose callee is not a closure is undefined.
   That is so of the machine as it is, and will not be once a partial
   application is a value that may be called (the change of the
   machine for partial applications and over-applications, which is
   being made). So the two statements for the shortcut, of which one
   gives [Invalid], are left for after that change: they need that a
   partial application has no type on which the shortcut answers.

   The number of arguments. Nothing here looks at the arities: the
   equivalence is of the call as it is, with as many arguments as it
   has. Where the machine gives a call with fewer or more arguments
   than the code has parameters no step (today), it gives none to
   either call; where it runs them as a partial application or an
   over-application (after the change above), a direct call of a
   closure of the code is the generic application that the indirect
   one is, and the statement of ../../rocq/FlambdaApplySpec.v that is
   used here is kept for any number of arguments.

   Code ids. The code answered is the very code of the closure
   ([single_closures_entry_holds], FlambdaProversSpec.v, which has the
   CR): the model has no code age relation. So a call that is direct
   already, whose code id Simplify meets with the one of the type as
   said above, keeps its code id here.

   What is assumed.
   - Strict satisfaction ([env_satisfies_strictly]), as for every
     statement that reads a type through a prover
     (FlambdaSimplifyPrimitivesSpec.v says why).
   - Nothing of kinds, and nothing of the well-formedness of types:
     the prover's statement is of every type.

   The proofs are in FlambdaSimplifyApplyProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
