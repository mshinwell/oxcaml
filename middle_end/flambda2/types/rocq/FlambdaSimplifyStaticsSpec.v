(* The types that Simplify gives the symbols of a [Let_static], and the
   body of the [Let_static] rewritten with them.

   This file is to be reviewed: the definitions and the statements,
   against middle_end/flambda2/simplify/simplify_static_const.ml
   ([simplify_static_consts], [simplify_static_const_of_kind_value],
   [simplify_field_of_block], [simplify_or_variable],
   [simplify_static_const_block_type]) and, for the closures,
   middle_end/flambda2/simplify/simplify_set_of_closures.ml
   ([simplify_lifted_sets_of_closures]). It follows
   FlambdaSimplifyProjectionsSpec.v and FlambdaSimplifyBoxingSpec.v,
   which have the same for a block and a boxed number that a primitive
   makes, FlambdaSimplifyApplySpec.v, which has the type of a closure
   that a [Let] makes, and FlambdaSimplifyPrimitivesSpec.v, which has
   the type of an argument ([argument_type]), the function that
   computes it ([simplify_simples]) and what is assumed: strict
   satisfaction of the environment.

   At a group of static bindings Simplify defines the symbols that the
   group binds, and gives each one a type made from the types of the
   [Simple]s of its constant ([bind_result_sym]: [DE.define_symbol],
   then [DE.add_equation_on_symbol]; for a closure, when the set is
   simplified). The body is simplified with those types: of a load
   from a symbol bound to a block, of the unboxing of a symbol bound
   to a boxed number, or of the callee of a call that is a symbol
   bound to a closure, the provers answer as they do of a variable.
   The function that puts the rewrites together
   (FlambdaSimplifyPassSpec.v) defines the symbols with no types; here
   is what it needs to give them their types.

   The order is the compiler's ([simplify_static_consts]). The symbols
   that the group binds to closures are defined first, with no type.
   Then the other symbols, in the order of the group: the type of the
   constant is taken in the environment as it is then, in which the
   symbol itself, and the symbols that the group binds later to
   constants that are not closures, are not defined unless the
   environment had them defined before the group; the symbol is
   defined and given the type. ([add_static_bindings].) A constant
   that names a symbol not defined then gets no type here; in the
   compiler that is a fatal error, the symbol not being bound in the
   typing environment (discrepancy T3-11: the model's group may be
   recursive, and such a constant has a value). A constant that names
   a symbol that the group binds to a closure, later or not, does get
   its type: that symbol is defined by then. Last, the symbols bound
   to closures are given their types
   ([simplify_lifted_sets_of_closures]). The types of the value slots
   of all of them are taken first, in the environment in which the
   other symbols of the group have their types and no closure of the
   group has ([add_closure_bindings], whose first argument is that
   environment).

   The types ([static_const_type], from the types of the [Simple]s of
   the constant, [static_const_simples]):
   - a block: the model's static block is the compiler's immutable
     block of the shape [Value_only]. The compiler's mutable and
     unique static blocks, and those of a mixed shape, whose fields
     may hold naked numbers, are not constants of the model, and this
     says nothing of them. The type is that of the blocks of the tag
     whose fields have the types of the fields, which are aliases
     ([simplify_static_const_block_type]); it is the type that
     [Make_block] gives its variable
     (FlambdaSimplifyProjectionsSpec.make_block_type). The tag is to
     be one of a block that is scanned, and the types of the fields of
     the kind value: the compiler's tag is scannable by its type, and
     on a field whose kind is not the one that the shape gives it,
     which for this shape is value, the compiler stops with a fatal
     error ([simplify_field_of_block]).
   - a boxed number: the type of the boxed numbers whose contents have
     the type of the contents; it is the type that [Box_number] gives
     its variable. Which boxed number it is, is read off the kind of
     that type: the model's constant does not say. For contents that
     are a constant this is the type that the compiler computes
     ([T.this_boxed_float] and the like). For contents that are a
     variable it is not what the compiler does: there the compiler
     asks the environment for the type of the variable at the kind
     value, where the variable holds the naked number, and stops with
     a fatal error (discrepancy T3-10). The model's constant has a
     value there, and this is the type of that value.
   - an immutable string: the type of that string
     ([T.this_immutable_string]).
   - a closure: the type of the closures at its function slot of a
     set that has exactly the functions of the constant, each of the
     code named, and its value slots, each of the type of its
     [Simple]: FlambdaSimplifyApplySpec.closure_of_set_type and
     set_of_closures_type, the types that a closure made by a [Let]
     gets there. Simplify gives more: the types of the other closures
     of the set, each an alias of its symbol, and the mode of the
     allocation, which for a static closure is the heap. A constant
     whose function slot is not among the functions of its set gets a
     type that nothing has; such a constant has no value
     (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.eval_static_const).

   The statements:
   - a symbol that the static environment binds to the value of a
     constant, as a group that binds it leaves it, has the type of the
     constant ([static_const_typed_statement]), and that type speaks
     only of variables in scope ([static_const_type_in_scope_statement]);
   - so the environment in which the symbol is defined and given that
     type is satisfied ([symbol_typed_env_satisfies_statement]), and so
     is the environment that [add_static_bindings] makes, by the static
     environment that the group makes
     ([add_static_bindings_env_satisfies_statement]);
   - and the body of a [Let_static] may be rewritten under that
     environment ([let_static_typed_statement]);
   - the symbols that the environment made has defined are those that
     the environment had and those that the group binds
     ([add_static_bindings_defined_symbols_statement]: the function
     that puts the rewrites together reads them for the environment of
     the code that the group binds);
   - the type of a constant and the environment made commute with
     renaming ([static_const_type_in_rename_statement],
     [add_static_bindings_rename_statement]).
   - An example: the first field of a static block, loaded from its
     symbol, is the [Simple] that the field was given
     ([example_load_of_static_block_statement]).

   Not here: that the environment made passes the test of
   well-formedness that the function which puts the rewrites together
   makes before it rewrites. The types of the symbols as they are
   seen in the body of code, which runs later and under other
   variables, are in FlambdaSimplifyCodeEnvSpec.v, with an example of
   a call of a symbol bound to a closure.

   Nothing is assumed of the term: where a symbol is bound twice, or a
   constant has no value, the [Let_static] is undefined and anything
   refines it.

   The proofs are in FlambdaSimplifyStaticsProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
