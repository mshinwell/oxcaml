(* Simplifying a [Switch] from the type of its scrutinee: the arms that
   cannot be taken are removed.

   This file is to be reviewed: the definitions and the statements,
   against [simplify_switch] of
   middle_end/flambda2/simplify/simplify_switch_expr.ml and
   [create_switch] of middle_end/flambda2/simplify/expr_builder.ml.
   Refinement relative to a typing environment is
   FlambdaTypingEnvRefinementSpec.v; the contract of the meet is
   FlambdaMeetSpec.v; the machine is ../../rocq/FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v;
   what it is for a static environment to be valid is
   ../../rocq/FlambdaClosuresSpec.v.

   What Simplify does. It reads the type of the scrutinee from its
   typing environment ([Simplify_simple.simplify_simple]: the alias
   type of the canonical element of the scrutinee at the normal name
   mode, with that element).
   For each arm it meets that type with the type of the number of the
   arm ([this_naked_immediate]), in the environment where the [Switch]
   is. Where the meet is bottom the arm is dropped. If one arm is left
   the [Switch] becomes the [Apply_cont] of that arm; if none is left
   it becomes [Invalid]; otherwise it is a [Switch] on the canonical
   element with the arms that are left. [simplify_switch] here is that
   function, with the meet as a parameter.

   What is stated.
   - Of the machine alone: a [Switch] with no arm is [Invalid]
     ([switch_no_arms_statement]), and a [Switch] refines what
     [switch_of_arms] makes of its arms
     ([switch_of_arms_refines_statement]). The second is a refinement
     and not an equivalence: a [Switch] with one arm is undefined where
     its scrutinee is not the number of the arm, and the [Apply_cont]
     is not.
   - Under a typing environment, in the states whose static
     environment is valid ([expr_refines_under_valid],
     [expr_equivalent_under_valid]; [under_valid_weaken_statement]
     says how they compare with the notions without that premise): the
     arms that cannot be taken in any such state that satisfies the
     environment may be removed ([arm_not_taken],
     [switch_without_arms_statement]). In every state that satisfies
     the environment, the scrutinee may be replaced by its canonical
     element ([switch_canonical_statement]). Both are equivalences.
   - That Simplify's test is right: an arm whose meet is bottom cannot
     be taken ([pruned_arm_not_taken_statement]). So the [Switch] with
     the arms that the test keeps is equivalent to the [Switch]
     ([prune_arms_equivalent_statement]), and what [simplify_switch]
     answers refines it ([simplify_switch_refines_statement]). The last
     is the statement for a pass over terms to use: its premises are
     the two on the meet and its environment below, and that the
     scrutinee may occur in terms, which is a test.
   - Of the transcribed meet that the contract is proved of
     ([meet_to_prove], FlambdaMeetSpec.v): it has what is asked of a
     meet here ([meet_to_prove_bottom_sound_statement]), so with it
     the statement for a pass has no premise on the meet, and one on
     the join ([simplify_switch_of_meet_to_prove_refines_statement]).
   - The functions commute with a renaming of variables
     ([arm_kept_rename_statement], [prune_arms_rename_statement],
     [simplify_switch_rename_statement]), for a meet that does
     ([meet_equivariant]).
   - Two small terms ([example_switch_no_arm_statement],
     [example_switch_comparison_statement]).

   What is assumed.
   - The contract of the meet, as far as it is needed:
     [meet_bottom_sound meet] (FlambdaMeetSpec.v), which says that
     where a meet answers bottom no value has both types. The
     statements are about any function [meet] that has it. The
     transcribed meet that the contract is proved of ([meet_to_prove])
     has it, whatever the fuel, with any join that has the contract
     of a join ([join_scoped_envs_sound]): that is
     [meet_to_prove_sound_statement] of FlambdaMeetClosuresSpec.v,
     which gives [meet_sound], from which [meet_bottom_sound] follows
     ([meet_answers_bottom_statement]). What that leaves, as that file
     says: [meet_to_prove] is not the compiler's meet ([compiler_meet],
     FlambdaMeetSpec.v, says where the two differ, and the compiler's
     has not [meet_sound]); that the compiler's join has the contract
     of a join is not shown; and nothing is said where the fuel runs
     out, where [simplify_switch] answers nothing. The statements are
     not made at a prover: Simplify asks the meet here, not a prover,
     and what is stated is about the test that it makes. The two
     examples run [meet_to_prove] with the join that forgets
     ([forgetful_join], FlambdaMeetExamplesSpec.v), which has the
     contract of a join, and have no hypothesis.
   - What the contract asks of the environment of a meet:
     [typing_env_fits tenv] (FlambdaMeetSpec.v, which says what in it
     is not known of the environments of the compiler). The two types
     that are met need no premise: the type of a number fits any
     environment, and the type that the environment answers for a
     [Simple] fits it ([type_simple_in_term_fits_statement]). Nor do
     their kinds: where the scrutinee is a naked immediate in the
     machine its type is of that kind, and where it is not the [Switch]
     is undefined.
   - That the static environment is valid ([statics_valid],
     ../../rocq/FlambdaClosuresSpec.v): the contract of the meet
     supposes it (FlambdaMeetSpec.v says why), and the states of a run
     of a well-formed unit have it. [expr_refines_under] of
     FlambdaTypingEnvRefinementSpec.v is about every state that
     satisfies the environment, valid or not, so what rests on the
     meet is stated here of [expr_refines_under_valid], which is that
     notion with the one premise more. A statement of that file about
     a binder does not carry it: its premise is about every state. For
     the examples, the two about a [Let] that they use are proved
     again with the premise, in the Proofs file.
   - Strict satisfaction ([env_satisfies_strictly]), which is what
     [expr_refines_under] is made of and what the contract of the meet
     is about. After the unboxing of variants the environments that
     Simplify builds are satisfied only where poison is exempt
     (decision D26), and these statements do not apply there.
   - That the scrutinee may occur in terms
     ([Typing_env.mem_simple] at the normal name mode). Simplify does
     not test it: its terms are closed in its environment. It is what
     makes the value that the machine has for the scrutinee the one
     that a valuation has.

   Renaming. What is stated of [arm_kept], [prune_arms] and
   [simplify_switch] under a renaming supposes that the meet commutes
   with the renaming of its environment and of its two types
   ([meet_equivariant]). That is a hypothesis here, as the contract of
   the meet is: nothing in this file, and nothing yet in the files of
   the meet, says that the transcribed meet has it, and it is for the
   owner of the meet to state and prove. Until then the three
   statements discharge nothing for a pass that needs its functions
   to be equivariant. The renaming of typing environments and what it
   does to [Typing_env.type_simple_in_term_exn] are
   FlambdaEnvRenameSpec.v.

   The arms. In the compiler the arms are a map from numbers; here
   they are a list, and the machine takes the first arm for a number
   (../../rocq/FlambdaModel.v). The test of an arm reads its number
   only, so a list with two arms for one number loses both or neither,
   and the statements hold of any list. [switch_of_arms] counts the
   arms of the list; on a list that has two arms for one number and no
   other it answers the [Switch], where the compiler has no such
   [Switch] to answer about.

   Where the model answers nothing. [simplify_switch] is [None] where
   the scrutinee has no type or no canonical element at the normal name
   mode, which are fatal errors of the compiler, and where a meet
   answers nothing (FlambdaMeetSpec.v says what that stands for, at
   [meet_function]). The compiler makes the meets in the order of the
   numbers and stops at the first that fails; which one that is the
   model does not say.

   Not here: what each arm teaches (the environment that the meet
   answers for an arm, in which Simplify simplifies the arguments of
   the arm and which it records for the continuation); the arms that
   are removed on the way up ([rebuild_arm]); the arms that are the
   same [Apply_cont], which [create_switch] makes one
   ([switch_same_arms_statement], ../../rocq/FlambdaControlFlowSpec.v,
   is the law); the merging of arms and the rewrites of a boolean
   [Switch] ([rebuild_switch]).

   The proofs are in FlambdaSimplifySwitchProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)

(* CR mshinwell: these are here because the contract of the meet came
   to suppose a valid static environment after the notions of
   FlambdaTypingEnvRefinementSpec.v were made, and this is the first
   statement about terms that rests on the meet. Every rewrite of
   Simplify that asks the meet will need the premise. It cannot simply
   be added to [expr_refines_under], whose statements about handlers
   are about every state: a handler runs under a static environment
   that has grown since its [Let_cont], a [Let_static] may bind what
   is not valid, and that the static environment stays valid is known
   of the runs of a well-formed unit
   ([well_formed_values_valid_statement],
   ../../rocq/FlambdaClosuresSpec.v) and not of every term.
   Decided with the owner of the function that simplifies a whole term
   by types: the pruning does not go into that function, whose theorem
   is about every state and is what the validator's rests on. It goes
   into a second function, with a theorem of its own about the states
   whose static environment is valid; the premise is not carried
   through the first. ../../rocq/FlambdaContextWhereSpec.v has the
   form for a rewrite that is sound only from the states that have a
   predicate which a step keeps; a valid static environment is not
   such a predicate by itself, and which predicate the second theorem
   is made of is not decided. *)
