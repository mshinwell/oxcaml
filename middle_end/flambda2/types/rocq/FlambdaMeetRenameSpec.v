(* The meet commutes with a renaming of variables.

   This file is to be reviewed: the action of a renaming on what the
   functions of the meet take and answer, and the statements. The
   renaming of types is FlambdaTypeRenameSpec.v, of typing
   environments FlambdaEnvRenameSpec.v, of an expanded type
   FlambdaProversRenameSpec.v ([rename_expanded], with the statement
   that [expand_head] commutes with it). The meet is FlambdaMeet.v and
   FlambdaMeetEnv.v; its contract, FlambdaMeetSpec.v, does not speak
   of renaming.

   The compiler has no such statement: its meet is not given renamed
   environments. It is here because every function of the model that
   reads names is to commute with renaming, and because the rewrites
   that ask the meet (the arms of a [Switch] that the type of the
   scrutinee excludes, FlambdaSimplifySwitchSpec.v) are to commute
   with it for the validation to use them.

   What is stated is an equation: of a renamed environment and
   renamed types, the meet answers the renamed answer. The meet makes
   no variable and goes by no order of names; where it chooses between
   two names it is by their binding times, which a renaming keeps.
   The join that it is given makes variables, and is a parameter: the
   statement is for a join that commutes with renaming in the same
   sense ([join_scoped_envs_equivariant]). The join that forgets
   (FlambdaMeetExamplesSpec.v) does. A join that makes new variables
   by a choice that looks at the names it is given has not that
   property, and nothing here is stated of a meet that is given such
   a join. A statement up to the choice of the new variables is not
   made and not proved: it would need a contract of the join that
   says which variables are new and where they may occur.

   The statements, proved in FlambdaMeetRenameProofs.v, which needs
   no review.
   - The meet of expanded types commutes with renaming at every fuel
     ([meet_expanded_head_at_fuel_equivariant_statement]), and so
     does the meet of types ([meet_of_types_equivariant_statement]):
     for every join that commutes, and for choices ([meet_choices],
     FlambdaMeet.v) whose type for the scrutinee of a tag every
     renaming of variables fixes ([meet_choices_closed]). The other
     two choices are booleans.
   - Both records of choices are such
     ([compiler_choices_closed_statement],
     [repaired_choices_closed_statement]); so the statement holds of
     the meet that the contract is proved of and of the meet as the
     compiler has it ([meet_to_prove_equivariant_statement],
     [compiler_meet_equivariant_statement]).
   - The join that forgets commutes
     ([forgetful_join_equivariant_statement]); so the meet that the
     contract is proved of, with that join, commutes with no premise
     ([meet_with_forgetful_join_equivariant_statement]). That is the
     meet that the rewrite of the [Switch] is stated for.
   - The functions that add to a typing environment commute, as the
     meet of types does
     ([typing_env_functions_equivariant_statement]).

   What the statements do not say. Nothing of a meet that stops: where
   the one answers [None] the other does, and that is all. Nothing of
   the compiler's own join, which is not transcribed as a function
   that commutes on the nose (FlambdaJoinSpec.v). And the fuel is the
   same on both sides: a renaming changes no depth. *)
