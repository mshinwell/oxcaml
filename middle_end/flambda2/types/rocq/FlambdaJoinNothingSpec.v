(* The join that the meet calls, of environments to which nothing was
   added.

   This file is to be reviewed: the two statements. The proofs are in
   FlambdaJoinNothingProofs.v, which needs no review.

   The meet of two variants, and of two row-like structures, enters a
   scope for each alternative and joins the environments of the
   alternatives that are left, even where no name was met in them:
   it then joins environments that are each the environment of the
   meet one scope further, with nothing added. The statements about
   the fuel of the meet (FlambdaMeetDepthSpec.v) suppose of the join
   that it then answers one environment, whatever meet of expanded
   types it is given, and that this environment has the typing
   environment of the environment of the meet ([join_of_nothing],
   same file). Here that is shown of the join of the model
   ([model_join_scoped_envs], FlambdaJoinMeet.v), with any test for
   recovering relations and at any depth, where the fuel of the join
   of environments is not zero; the first statement is the body of
   that predicate at that join, under that premise on the fuel:
   - the join answers an environment that has the typing environment
     of the environment of the meet, the same whatever meet of
     expanded types it is given, and whatever the two other amounts
     of fuel ([model_join_scoped_envs_of_nothing_statement]). No
     invariant is asked of the environment, which may be bottom. The
     environment answered is not the one given: its names to avoid
     are those of the join.
   - With no fuel for the join of environments, and an environment
     that is not bottom, the join answers nothing
     ([model_join_scoped_envs_no_fuel_statement]): the first of the
     rounds that join the types kept reads the fuel before it looks
     at what there is to join. So the premise on the fuel is needed.

   Nothing is assumed beyond the premises of each statement. *)
