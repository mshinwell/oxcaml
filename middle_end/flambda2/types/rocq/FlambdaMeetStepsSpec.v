(* What the functions that the meet is made of keep, one function at a
   time.

   This file is to be reviewed: the statements, which are about the
   functions of FlambdaMeet.v. The contract of the whole meet is in
   FlambdaMeetSpec.v; it is to be proved from statements of this kind,
   and the join of types uses some of these functions too. The proofs
   are in FlambdaMeetStepsProofs.v, which needs no review.

   What is stated so far.
   - [reduce_head_of_kind_naked_immediate] loses no value
     ([reduce_head_of_kind_naked_immediate_sound_statement]): under a
     valuation that satisfies the environment strictly, a value that
     has a head of naked immediates has the head that the function
     answers, and the function does not answer bottom. Nothing else is
     asked of the environment or of the head. The function reads, for
     each relation of the head, the canonical element of the name that
     the relation is on: a constant gives the number, by the
     compiler's reading of a relation on a constant
     ([Relation.of_const]), and the relation goes; a name replaces the
     name. That the number so read is the number that the relation
     relates the constant to is a statement of
     FlambdaTypeMeaningSpec.v, which on the branch that this one is
     made from still has the older meaning of relations, in which
     [Is_int] relates a poison constant to every number. Until the
     amended statement is under this file it is a premise here
     ([relation_of_const_exact]), which is then to go.
   - What it is for the meet of a part of a type to be right
     ([meet_call_ok], [part_meet_ok]): the two halves of the contract
     of the whole meet, for a part of any type, given what it is for
     such a part to fit an environment and to be true of the value in
     hand. The meets of parts are put together from one another, and
     each statement below says that one way of putting them together
     keeps this: [map_result] ([map_result_ok_statement]),
     [meet_unknown] ([meet_unknown_ok_statement]), [combine_results2]
     ([combine_results2_ok_statement]). An answer that is one of the
     inputs is right because the inputs stay fitting and true as the
     environment and the valuation are extended ([part_stable]);
     nothing is said of how precise an answer is.
   - Sets: [set_meet] answers what both sets have
     ([set_meet_cases_statement]); the meet of two heads of naked
     numbers is right ([naked_number_meet_ok_statement]). *)
