(* What a Flambda type means: which values of the machine have it.

   This file is to be reviewed: what the meaning reads of a value (the
   first section), [type_satisfied] and what it is made of, and the
   statements. The grammar is FlambdaTypeGrammar.v. The compiler has no
   such definition to compare with: what a type means there is what
   [Meet], [Join] and the provers ([Provers], [Expand_head]) take it to
   mean, and those are the files to read this against, with the creation
   functions of [Type_grammar] and [More_type_creators]. Every later
   statement about types (the environment, meet, join, the provers) is
   made with [type_satisfied], so a mistake here is a mistake in all of
   them.

   The compiler has two implementations of meet and join: [Meet_and_join]
   (meet_and_join.ml, with join_levels_old.ml), which is the one it runs
   unless told otherwise, at every optimisation level, and
   [Meet_and_n_way_join], which it runs for the n-way join algorithm
   and for match-in-match ([Meet.meet] chooses, by
   [Flambda_features.use_n_way_join]). A function named below is in
   both under that name unless one is said; where the two differ it is
   said.

   The environment. A type mentions names: the [Simple] of an alias, the
   variables that hold the results of [Is_int], [Get_tag] and [Is_null],
   the names an environment extension has equations on. So a value has a
   type relative to an environment, of which the meaning needs two
   things and no more:
   - the values of variables, [vars], an environment of the machine. It
     is used through [eval_simple] and [lookup] only;
   - the static environment, [statics]: what symbols are bound to. A
     symbol is a value by itself, a pointer, and a type says what it
     points to. It is used only through the observations of the first
     section.
   Nothing of the typing environment is needed (levels, binding times,
   canonical aliases): that is what is known, and this is what is true.
   What satisfies a typing environment is for the file that defines one
   to say, with [type_satisfied] for each name it has a type for. A
   variable that exists only in types has to have a value in [vars] all
   the same; to say that there is one is the typing environment's
   business.

   What the meaning is, in short ([type_satisfied]):
   - [Unknown] at a kind: every value of that kind. [Bottom]: none.
   - An alias [Equals s] at a kind: the value of [s], if of that kind.
     So a value has a type only if it has the kind of the type
     ([type_satisfied_kind_statement]).
   - A head of kind value: [Null], if [is_null] allows it; or a value
     that is not [Null] and has the [non_null] part.
   - [Variant]: a tagged immediate whose number has the type
     [immediates], or a block that the row-like structure [blocks]
     admits: the case of its tag, or failing one the case [other_tags],
     fixes its size, its shape and the types of its fields.
   - [Boxed_number]: a box of that number whose contents have the
     type given. [Closures]: a closure at a function slot whose case
     admits its set of closures. [String]: one of the strings.
     [Mutable_block]: nothing, see below.
   - A set of numbers: a number of the kind that is in the set. For a
     naked immediate, also the result of each relation listed, on the
     value of the name it is listed with ([relation_holds]).
   - An environment extension, where it is attached (a case of a
     row-like structure, the two extensions of a variant): each name has
     the type of its equation.

   Choices to check, each taken from what [Meet] does:
   - The heads of kind value are disjoint: a block, a boxed number, a
     closure and a string are four different things
     ([meet_head_of_kind_value_non_null]: "This assumes that all the
     different constructors are incompatible"). The observations of the
     machine are disjoint to match ([observations_disjoint_statement],
     in FlambdaValueSpec.v).
   - The variables [is_int], [get_tag] and [is_null] of a type and the
     relations of a naked immediate say the same thing from two sides,
     and the compiler records the two together
     ([Typing_env.add_is_null_relation] and the two beside it, in
     flambda2_types.ml). So they agree here: the variable of a type
     holds a number that the relation relates to each value of the type
     ([is_null_coherent_statement], [is_int_coherent_statement],
     [get_tag_coherent_statement]). The variables [is_int] and [is_null]
     say so of every value of the type, [get_tag] of its blocks only
     ([meet_variant] says why).
   - A product (the fields of a block, the closures and the value slots
     of a set of closures) says something of the components that exist
     and nothing of the others: an absent component is unknown, and what
     exists is for the index of the case to say ([Type_grammar]:
     "{ 1 => Unknown; 2 => V } is equal to { 2 => V }"). The function
     types of a set of closures are read in the same way: the code of a
     function is said if the set has the function. The n-way join
     needs that: it keeps a function type that only some of the types
     joined have, under an index that no longer says that the set has
     the function ([n_way_join_closures_entry]; the other join,
     [join_closures_entry], keeps a function type only if all have
     it). The closure of a set without the function has to have the
     joined type ([closure_absent_function_has] in the Proofs). The
     code of a function is known where the index says that the set has
     it ([closures_case_function_code_statement]), and always for the
     function at the slot of the closure itself
     ([closures_case_own_code_statement]): those are the two cases in
     which a prover reads a function type
     ([Row_like_for_closures.get_single_tag], [Provers.prove_code_ids]).
     Even read so, the n-way join is not always an upper bound: where
     one type says nothing of the code of the function at the slot of
     the closure and another names it, the joined type names it
     ([nway_join_has_not] in the Proofs).
   - A relation is not the execution of its primitive
     ([relation_holds]). It relates a value and a number wherever the
     compiler records it of them, which is not where the primitive has
     a result:
     - [Is_null] relates every value of kind value: to 1 if it is
       [Null], to 0 if not, poison and a symbol that is not bound
       included. That is the compiler's reading of a constant
       ([Relation.of_const], by [Reg_width_const.is_null];
       [is_null_of_const_statement]), and the type of a scrutinee with
       a variable [is_null] admits all these. The primitive has no
       value on a symbol that is not bound, which no well-formed term
       uses, nor on poison.
     - [Is_int] relates a tagged immediate to 1 and a block to 0. It
       says nothing of poison, which it relates to every number (see
       below, on poison), and it relates no other value. The compiler
       records it for [Is_int { variant_only = true }]
       ([Simplify_unary_primitive.simplify_is_int]) and for a parameter
       that is unboxed as a variant, of a scrutinee that it takes to be
       a variant and not null ([add_is_int_relation]). Its reading of a
       constant is wider, 0 for [Null] and 1 for every other constant
       ([Relation.of_const]); the two agree where this one says
       something of a constant that is not poison
       ([relation_of_const_sound_statement]).
     - [Get_tag] relates a block to its tag, and a tagged immediate to
       any number, as it does poison. Unboxing records it of a
       parameter that may be an
       immediate (simplify/unboxing/build_unboxing_denv.ml), and passes
       the tag 0 on the paths where it is one (unboxing_epa.ml,
       [compute_extra_args_for_variant]); [add_get_tag_relation] keeps
       the immediates for that reason, and on a constant
       [reduce_head_of_kind_naked_immediate] drops the relation. The
       primitive has no value on an immediate, and nothing here gives
       it one.
     The result of a primitive, where it has one, is related
     ([primitive_related_statement]), and that is all that ties the
     two. Where a primitive has a result is not said here.
   - One reduction of [Meet] is not sound for this meaning, nor for any
     under which the environments that unboxing makes are true: from a
     relation [Get_tag] whose number is among some tags,
     [reduce_inverse_relations] makes the name a block with one of
     those tags, where it may be an immediate.
     [relation_get_tag_statement] has what does follow. Its other
     reductions are sound ([relation_is_null_statement]), that of
     [Is_int] for a value that is not poison
     ([relation_is_int_statement]).
   - Poison. A fact of the types is about a value that is not poison
     (decision D26 of the project). The compiler gives a poison
     constant the unknown type of its kind
     ([More_type_creators.type_for_const]), but unboxing says more of
     names that hold poison. For a field of a variant that is unboxed
     in turn, it passes poison on the paths where the argument has no
     such field, with 0 for the tag and for [Is_int] of it
     (unboxing_epa.ml); and the environment of the handler has the
     shape and the relations of that field on every path
     (build_unboxing_denv.ml, [denv_of_decision]). So that such an
     environment is true on those paths:
     - a relation says nothing of a value that is poison: [Is_int] and
       [Get_tag] relate poison to every number ([relation_holds]).
       [Is_null] relates a poison of kind value to 0, as it does every
       value of that kind that is not [Null], and no other poison to
       anything;
     - what satisfies a typing environment is to ask nothing of the
       type of a name whose value is poison. That is for the file that
       defines one to say;
     - the types of a poison value are as they were. It has the types
       that say no more of a value than its kind, that it is this
       value, or that it is not [Null] (the unknown type, an alias to
       it, [any_non_null_value]), and none that says what it is: it is
       no immediate, no block, nothing allocated. The equations of an
       environment extension inside a type are of every value, poison
       included.
     The compiler relies on something that nothing in it checks: where
     a parameter holds poison, no use that reads it and no meet of its
     type to bottom is reachable. And what is concluded from a
     relation has the case of poison to set aside
     ([relation_is_int_statement], [relation_get_tag_statement]): a
     statement that uses a fact about a name is to treat apart the
     case in which the name holds poison.
   - The code of a function type is the code of the closure, the very
     code id. The compiler means "that code or a newer version of it"
     ([Code_age_relation]); that is for the workstream on calls (S4) to
     put here, with a relation between code ids. Until then this is a
     restriction and not only something left out: a closure made with
     a newer version of the code has not, here, the type that names
     the older one, and the compiler takes it to have it
     ([meet_code_id] and the join of function types go by the
     relation; [Simplify_apply_expr] compares the code of the type
     with that of the call by it, and may make the call [Invalid]). So
     what is stated of meet, join and reification with this meaning is
     to leave out the types that name code, or to bring the relation
     in; and the code id that a prover answers is not to be read as
     the code of the closure at run time.
   - Allocation modes and [is_unique] mean nothing here: the machine has
     no regions, and uniqueness is about what may be duplicated. They
     matter to the compiler: a prover answers with the allocation mode
     of a type, or that a value holds nothing allocated locally
     ([Provers.never_holds_locally_allocated_values]); [Reify] lifts
     on the strength of that; and uniqueness is kept by meet and join
     and goes from a type to the block that reification makes
     ([Immutable_unique]). So what is stated with this meaning is
     about which values a type has. It says nothing of locality, of
     lifetime, of what may be duplicated or of whether lifting is
     safe: those need an invariant or a richer machine. In particular
     two values with equal contents are not thereby one symbol.

   What the meaning does not need and the operations will. [Meet] makes
   the meet of two products empty as soon as one component has no value
   ([meet_mapping]), and takes two shapes that differ to have no block
   in common ([meet_row_like_for_blocks]). Neither is true of the
   meaning as it stands, for every type of the grammar: an empty block
   has the type of the blocks of at least no field whose first field
   has no value, and a block of one field that is a value has both the
   shape [Value_only] and the shape [Mixed_record 1 []]
   ([wide_product_has] and [mixed_record_of_values_has] in the Proofs).
   They are true of the types in which:
   - the product of a case of blocks is no wider than the size of its
     index ([block_case_empty_statement]), and as wide if the size is
     exact ([Reify] asserts that);
   - the function types, the closure types and the value slot types of
     a case of closures are of slots among those of its index
     ([closures_case_function_code_statement],
     [closures_case_value_slot_statement]), and an exact index has the
     slot of the case among its closures;
   - a shape is written in one way: a mixed record has a flat suffix
     ([block_shapes_disjoint_statement]);
   - the kinds are right: those that the creation functions check
     (FlambdaTypeGrammar.v lists them), and those of the fields of a
     block against its shape, which the compiler checks only with its
     invariant checks on ([Row_like_for_blocks.check_field_tys]).
   The creation functions of the compiler give such types if their
   callers give them what they expect, which they do not all check (a
   closure at a slot that its set has, closure types of slots of the
   set, field types of the kinds of the shape). Its raw constructors
   ([create_raw], which meet and join use) check nothing, and the
   n-way join does not keep the second condition (see above, on
   products). The statements named say what each condition gives,
   for one case. A predicate that says the conditions of a whole type,
   with the proof that the creation functions here establish it, is to
   be in this library before meet is stated. It is not here yet, and
   the meaning does not need it.

   What an answer of a prover is about. The provers of the compiler come
   in two forms ([Provers.gen_value_to_proof] and [gen_value_to_meet]).
   A proof is about every value of the type. A meet shortcut is not: it
   leaves out the alternatives on which the operation asked about has
   no value (of a type that may be [Null] it answers for the part that
   is not), so its answer is about the values of the type on which
   that operation is defined, and is to be stated so.

   Where the machine is behind the grammar. The meaning is that of the
   machine of today (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v), read through observations
   so that it changes with the machine and not with this file:
   - Blocks, boxed numbers and strings are read through the machine's
     [block_of], [boxed_number_of] and [string_of], and the kind of a
     value is the machine's [kind_of_value] (FlambdaValueSpec.v). A
     block or a boxed number is a value by itself or what a symbol is
     bound to, and what is said here of the one is said of the other. The
     two are different values all the same, and an alias tells them
     apart: a type [Equals s] is of the value of [s] and no other, so
     not of a symbol bound to a block with the tag and the fields of
     the block that [s] is. What is stated of lifting has to allow for
     that.
   - Closures are read through the machine's [closure_in_set] and
     [project_function_slot] (FlambdaValueSpec.v): a closure is the
     closure at a function slot of a set of closures, of which the
     machine has the code of each function slot and the values of the
     value slots. The closure of a set of one function whose slot has
     no name is read as the closure at [unnamed_function_slot] of a set
     with that one function. Nothing may rely on which slot the unnamed
     one is.
   - There are no mutable blocks, so [Mutable_block] has no value. With
     a heap (C4) it is to mean a mutable block, and a mutable block is
     then to be a block of [Variant] too, as [Meet] has it.
   - There is no value of kind [Region] or [Rec_info] but [Poison].
   - [Poison] is a value of its kind like another: at kind value it is
     not [Null], and it is no immediate and nothing allocated (see the
     choices above for the types it has). The contents of a boxed
     number may be poison; such a box has a type [Boxed_number] only if
     poison has the type of the contents.
   - The primitives are data (FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.v), and the relations
     are not defined with them. The result of [Is_null], of [Is_int]
     of a variant and of [Get_tag], where the primitive has one, is
     related to the value ([primitive_related_statement]). A constant
     is a tagged immediate here whatever its number; the primitives
     have a value only on one in the range of the machine. The two
     part only on a constant out of range, which no well-formed term
     is to have (decision D32, with D13): the difference goes when
     that is a condition of FlambdaWellFormedSpec.v.

   The statements say what each form of type means for the types built
   by the creation functions of the compiler, as an equivalence. The
   proofs are in FlambdaTypeMeaningProofs.v, which needs no review. It
   also has, for each constructor but [Mutable_block], a value that has
   a type built with it and a value that has not but would have one
   close to it; no value has a [Mutable_block] type. *)
