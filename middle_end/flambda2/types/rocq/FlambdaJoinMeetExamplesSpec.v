(* Examples of the n-way join of typing environments: what the join
   that Simplify calls answers on small inputs, with the meet, the
   join of types and the join of environments of the model put
   together ([model_join], FlambdaJoinMeet.v).

   To be reviewed: how the inputs are made, and each statement,
   against what the compiler's [Join_levels.cut_and_n_way_join]
   answers at a continuation whose parameter is given the types of
   the example at its uses.

   Why they are here. What is proved of the join says that what it
   adds to the target is true. A join that added nothing would have
   that too. The examples say what the model computes, with nothing
   stood in for: the same functions as in the statements, and
   environments made with the model's own [Typing_env.add_equation].
   An answer [None] on one of these inputs would be a fatal error of
   the compiler, too little fuel, or the state at which the model's
   meet stops and the compiler does not (FlambdaJoinMeet.v says
   which): there is none.

   What they are not. No answer here was read off a run of the
   compiler: each is what the model computes, and was compared with
   the compiler's code by reading.

   They have since been compared with the compiler by running, by the
   workstream of the differential tests of the types library, for
   every section but the last. The inputs were made in the compiler
   as they are here ([increment_scope], a definition and
   [Meet_env.add_equation] for each variable, then for [p]), and
   joined both by [Join_env.cut_and_n_way_join_with_analysis] and by
   [Join_levels.cut_and_n_way_join] with the n-way join chosen. The
   twelve agree with the statements: the type of [p], whether the
   target is bottom, the type of [a], and the two maps of
   definitions, sets compared as sets. What the compiler shows and
   the statements do not: where a variable is made for [Is_int] or
   [Get_tag], it has a type in the target, the numbers 0 and 1 with
   the relation on [p].

   The last section is three joins in a row, of the shape of the
   program of discrepancy T5-10. Its answers were compared with what
   the compiler prints for the three joins of that program (run by
   the workstream that demonstrated the discrepancy, with the n-way
   join and the types of the joins printed): on the variables that
   the example keeps, the equations are the same.

   The inputs. The source environment knows three variables of kind
   value that may occur in terms: [y], [z] and the parameter [p]. A
   use is the source one scope further, in which some variables may
   have been defined and given types, and in which [p] has been given
   a type, all by [Typing_env.add_equation]. The uses are joined
   after the scope of the source. What a statement shows of the
   answer: the type that the target has for [p]; whether the target
   is bottom; the two maps of definitions of the analysis; and the
   type that the target has for [a], a variable that some uses define
   and the source does not.

   The choices are the compiler's, the depth of the join is the
   compiler's default, 5, and the fuel is more than these inputs
   need. A new variable is one greater than the names to avoid, which
   are [y], [z], [p] and [a]: so the first variable that a join makes
   here is 5. The sets of numbers of the model are lists, and the
   order of the numbers in an answer is the one that the model makes;
   it has no meaning.

   The proofs are by computation, in FlambdaJoinMeetExamplesProofs.v,
   which needs no review. *)

(* Three joins, one after another, as Simplify makes them for a

        | 0 -> b0 = block of tag 0 (n); kx (b0)
        | 1 -> b1 = block of tag 1 (n); kx (b1))
       where kx (x) = pa = block of tag 0 (x); k0 (pa)

       where k2 (s) = switch t0 with 0 -> .. | 1 -> .. | 2 -> ..

   It is the shape of the program of discrepancy T5-10 (which has two
   more parameters, left out here), for which the compiler prints the
   types after each of its three joins, and deletes the last arm,
   which a run through [pb] and [k2 (p)] with [t0] equal to 2
   reaches. The model answers the same equations on these variables,
   and the same bottom:
   - at [kx], the tag of [x] is 0 at a use and 1 at the other, as
     [t0] is, so the join names it [t0], and records that [t0] is the
     tag of [x];
   - at [k0], [x] is a variable of the first use only; the join brings
     it into the target under its own name, with the type that it has
     at that use, which says that its tag is [t0]. On a run through
     the second use, [x] has no value and [t0] is any number;
   - at [k2], the field of the block is [x] at a use and [z] at the
     other; the join makes a variable for it, whose tag is [t0] at
     both ([z] is made where [t0] is 0), and records that [t0] is the
     tag of that variable. Its test for recording it is that every
     use has a type for the variable, and the first has one for [x];
   - in the arm where [t0] is 2, the meet reads the relation: the
     variable would be a block of tag 2, and its type has the tags 0
     and 1. The environment of the arm is bottom.
   This does not contradict [model_join_true_statement]: what it
   concludes is about the runs on which the scrutinees of the
   relations that the join adds have values
   ([relation_scrutinees_have_values]). At [k2], on the run through
   the second use of [k0] and the first of [k2], the new variable
   stands for [x], which has no value, while [t0] has one. (At [k0]
   nothing fails: the second use does not know [x], and nothing is
   asked or said of a variable brought in at a use that does not know
   it.) The statements here are computations; they prove nothing of
   runs. *)

   that join took its names to avoid from the meet's environment
   alone, which has none when a meet begins: the first example then
   answered [None], the join having made a variable that the
   environment knew. It now avoids the variables that the
   environments it is given know ([Join_env.variables_of_env]). *)
