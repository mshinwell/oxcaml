(* Examples of typing environments, with the environments of the machine
   that satisfy them and some that do not.

   This file is to be reviewed with FlambdaTypingEnvSpec.v: it is there
   to show that what that file states does not hold vacuously, and what
   it says in the cases that its header singles out (a name that has no
   value at run time, a variable that stands for nothing in a run, a
   symbol, code, poison). An environment that is satisfied is shown to
   be so strictly where it is; one that is not is shown not to be even
   with the names that hold poison exempt. The proofs are in
   FlambdaTypingEnvExamplesProofs.v, which needs no review.

   The first example is the environment that Simplify has built when it
   reaches the last line of

     let x = p in
     let c = <closure of code f, whose value slot w holds x> in
     let y = <the value slot w of c> in
     apply_cont k y

   where [p] is a parameter known to be the tagged immediate 7 or 8. It
   is built with the functions of FlambdaTypingEnv.v, called as the
   compiler calls them:
   - [p] is defined and given its type;
   - [x] is defined with the alias type [= p]: the aliases make [p] the
     canonical element of the two, [p] being bound earlier, and the type
     of [x], the name demoted, becomes [= p];
   - [c] is defined with the type of the closures of exactly that set,
     in which [x] has been replaced by its canonical element [p];
   - [y] is defined with the type of the value slot, [= p], as [x] was.
   Then [Typing_env.type_simple_in_term_exn] answers [p] for [y], so the
   last line is [apply_cont k p]. *)
