(* What it is for the values of a run to satisfy a typing environment,
   and what looking a name up in the environment says of its value.

   This file is to be reviewed: [typing_env_satisfied_but], the notions
   made with it ([typing_env_satisfied_strictly] and
   [typing_env_satisfied]; [env_satisfies_strictly] and [env_satisfies]
   for the machine), what they are made of, and the statements. Every
   later statement about types that is relative to an environment
   (meet, join, the provers, the rewrites of Simplify) takes one of
   them as a premise. So they have to be true of the environments that
   Simplify builds, or those statements say nothing of real programs;
   and strong enough that the type found for a name is a fact about its
   value. The environment itself is FlambdaTypingEnv.v, which is to be
   read against middle_end/flambda2/types/env/typing_env.ml; what a
   type means is FlambdaTypeMeaningSpec.v; the aliases are
   FlambdaEnvAliasesSpec.v. Examples, with environments of the machine
   that do and do not satisfy an environment, are
   FlambdaTypingEnvExamplesSpec.v.

   The compiler has no such definition to compare with. What an
   environment means there is what its users take it to mean, and those
   are what to read this against: [Typing_env.find] and
   [type_simple_in_term_exn] as Simplify calls them
   (simplify/simplify_simple.ml), [Expand_head.expand_head] and the
   provers; how Simplify extends the environment as it goes under
   binders (simplify/env/downwards_env.ml: [define_variable],
   [add_variable], [add_parameters], [enter_set_of_closures]); and how
   the environment of a handler is made from those of its uses
   (simplify/join_points.ml, types/join_levels_old.ml and
   types/env/join_env.ml).

   Valuations. An environment knows variables that have no value where
   the term runs:
   - those of name mode [In_types]: the variables that a join makes
     existential ([Meet_env.add_env_extension_from_level], and the
     n-way join, which defines them with
     [add_variable_definition ... In_types]), and those of an extension
     with extra variables. Such a variable stands for the value that a
     variable bound in the body of a [Let_cont] had at the use that
     jumped to the handler;
   - those of name mode [Phantom], which are for debugging information;
   - those that are out of scope. In the body of a function the
     environment is that of the place where the closure is made, with
     [min_binding_time] moved to the present
     ([Typing_env.closure_env]): its variables are still there, and
     the types of the value slots are aliases to them, but the machine
     runs the body with the parameters and the closure and nothing
     else. Such a variable stands for the value it had where the
     closure was made.
   So an environment is satisfied by a valuation: an environment of
   values, like the machine's, that may give a value to any variable
   that the typing environment knows ([typing_env_satisfied_but]). The
   machine satisfies a typing environment when it binds the variables
   in scope and some valuation that agrees with it on them satisfies
   the environment ([env_satisfies]). Which variables are in scope is
   the compiler's own test ([in_scope_in_terms]). Statements about
   types (meet, join, the provers) are to be made of valuations, as the
   types of an environment mention variables that are not in scope;
   statements about terms are to be made of the machine.
   FlambdaTypeMeaningSpec.v needs nothing else of the environment, and
   what it calls [vars] is the valuation.

   A valuation need not give a value to every variable that the
   environment knows. A variable that a join has made existential may
   stand for a variable that some uses of the continuation bind and
   others do not (the n-way join brings such a variable in with the
   join of its types at the uses that define it:
   types/env/join_env.ml); in a run that comes through one of the
   others it stands for nothing. The compiler also builds environments
   that are not bottom in which a name has the type bottom: the binary
   join works in one, in which the variables that it has not yet joined
   have that type (types/join_levels_old.ml, with
   [Meet_env.add_env_extension_maybe_bottom]). Of a name with no value
   nothing is asked. The alias type of such a name is the type of no value
   (FlambdaTypeMeaningSpec.v), and no name that has a value is an alias
   of it (FlambdaEnvAliasesSpec.v): so where a type mentions it, the
   type speaks of a case that is not the case in that run. A name that
   is reached through a value in hand, by an alias type that the value
   has, has a value. A statement about a name that is not so reached
   needs the premise that the name has a value: to add an equation on a
   name ([Meet_env.add_equation]), or to conclude from the type of a
   name being bottom that the program point is not reached. An
   environment in which a variable that exists only in types has the
   type bottom is satisfied, strictly, by the valuations that give the
   variable no value.

   What it is to satisfy an environment, and what was decided.
   - Names. Every name that has a type ([names_to_types]) and a value
     in the valuation: the value has the type
     ([names_have_their_types_but]). The type of a name is the one that
     this map has for it: the one that the last [replace_equation] gave
     it. The equations of the levels are the history of the environment
     and are not read. A value that has a type has the kind of the type
     (FlambdaTypeMeaningSpec.v).
   - Symbols. A symbol is a value by itself, a pointer, so it always has
     a value; its type says what the static environment binds it to. A
     symbol that is defined and has no equation ([defined_symbols]) has
     the type of the values that are not null, which a pointer is: so
     nothing is asked of it, not even that the static environment binds
     it.
   - Code. Nothing is asked. A function type says which code id a
     closure has (FlambdaTypeMeaningSpec.v); that the static environment
     binds the code id, and to what, is not part of an environment of
     types. (Simplify keeps the code in its own environment,
     [Downwards_env.all_code].)
   - Names that are exempt. [typing_env_satisfied_but] is given the
     names that are exempt: of the value of an exempt name only the
     kind of its type is asked. Two cases have names.
     [typing_env_satisfied_strictly]: no name is exempt. This is the
     one for the statements about types. With an exempt name what the
     compiler does with types is not right: if [n] has the type of the
     number 4 and holds poison, poison has the alias type of [n] and
     has not the type found for [n], so that to put the type of a name
     for an alias to it, as [Expand_head.expand_head] does, is wrong,
     and a meet that reaches [n] can answer bottom where there are
     values ([alias_has_type_found_statement] and
     FlambdaTypingEnvExamplesSpec.v).
     To be strictly satisfied is not to be free of poison. A name may
     hold poison where its type admits it: the unknown type, an alias
     of a name that holds it, the type of the values that are not null.
     By decision D26 as revised, a relation of a type ([Is_int],
     [Get_tag], [Is_null]) is never true of a scrutinee that holds
     poison. So a value that has a type with a relation has a scrutinee
     that is not poison, and a statement that reads a relation from the
     type of a name that has a value has no case of poison; of a name
     with no value the type says nothing, as above. This is so once
     FlambdaTypeMeaningSpec.v says it: until then [Is_int] and
     [Get_tag] there hold of a scrutinee that is poison, and such a
     statement has that case to deal with. (Where no name holds poison
     the two notions are one, [satisfied_no_poison_strictly_statement];
     that is a narrower case than to be strictly satisfied.)
     [typing_env_satisfied]: the names that hold poison are exempt,
     and those whose type is a relation on a name that holds poison
     ([exempt_by_poison]; decision D26; there is a CR there). Typing
     facts are about values that are not poison: a name that is not
     exempt has its type ([find_not_poison_statement]), and a use of a
     fact has the other case to deal with. Nothing else follows from
     it. It is there for what unboxing does: the parameters that stand
     for the fields of an inactive case of a variant are given their
     types on every path, and hold poison; and where such a field is
     unboxed in turn, its [Is_int] and tag parameters are given the
     relations to it as their types, and hold 0. Until then the
     environments that Simplify builds are strictly satisfied. Inside a
     type nothing changes: the fields of a block that is not poison
     have their types as FlambdaTypeMeaningSpec.v says, poison or not.
     The exemption of poison is by the value that the valuation gives,
     for every name. It cannot be only for the names in scope: a
     parameter that holds poison may be captured by a closure, and is
     out of scope in its body; and a variable that exists only in types
     may stand for one that a term bound at a use of a continuation,
     where it held poison. The environment does not record which is
     which.
   - Aliases are exact, poison or not: names in one class of the
     aliases have the same value, or none of them has a value
     ([aliases_respected], FlambdaEnvAliasesSpec.v). The compiler reads
     canonical elements from the aliases, not from the alias types, so
     this is asked of the aliases themselves. That the two agree is for
     the invariant of an environment.
   - An environment that is bottom is satisfied by nothing.
   - The levels, the scopes, the binding times and
     [next_binding_time] are not read: they are what the functions
     that build an environment and cut it need, and are for the
     invariant of an environment. Name modes and [min_binding_time]
     are read only to say which variables are in scope.

   Is it true of what Simplify builds? Where Simplify defines a
   variable and gives it a type, the machine binds the variable to a
   value of that type; a handler runs under the variables of the place
   of its definition; the body of a function, and the variables that a
   join makes existential, are what valuations are for. Where it is not
   known to be true, and a statement that takes it as a premise says
   nothing:
   - Lifting. Simplify gives a variable the type "is this symbol" when
     it lifts the block or the closure that the variable is bound to,
     and gives the symbol its type, at a place where the term as it was
     has bound no such symbol: only the term that Simplify produces
     binds it, earlier. The values of a run of the first term do not
     satisfy that environment. This is for the workstream on lifting
     (S5), which has two runs to relate; the environment is satisfied
     by the values of the second.
   - Unboxing of variants: from there on only [typing_env_satisfied]
     holds, of which the statements about types say nothing. The
     compiler relies on no fact about a parameter that holds poison
     being used on a path that runs; nothing checks that.
   - Kinds. That the machine binds a variable to a value of the kind it
     is defined with is a premise wherever a variable is defined; it is
     for the semantics to give (workstream C2).
   - What FlambdaTypeMeaningSpec.v leaves out: code age (a type that
     names code), allocation modes.

   What is stated: how the notions compare; that satisfaction depends
   only on the values of the variables that the environment mentions,
   and for the machine only on those in scope; what satisfies the empty
   environment and a bottom one; what [find] and [mem] say of a name;
   what the canonical element of a simple is, with
   [type_simple_in_term_exn], which is what Simplify does to every
   simple of a term. No statement here has a premise on the environment
   (an invariant): they hold of every environment. What the functions
   that build an environment do to satisfaction, binders, the invariant
   and the renaming of names are to follow.

   The proofs are in FlambdaTypingEnvProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
