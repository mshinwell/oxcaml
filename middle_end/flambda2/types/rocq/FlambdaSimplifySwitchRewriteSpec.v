(* The slices of the [Switch] as rewrites that the function which
   simplifies a whole term may be given.

   This file is to be reviewed: the statements. The functions are
   those of the second and the third slice
   (FlambdaSimplifySwitchArmsSpec.v, FlambdaSimplifySwitchMergeSpec.v);
   what is asked of a rewrite of a [Switch] is
   FlambdaSimplifyPruningSpec.v ([switch_rewrite],
   [switch_rewrite_sound]).

   The function of FlambdaSimplifyPruningSpec.v simplifies a whole
   term by types and takes, as a parameter, a function that may
   rewrite a [Switch] from the typing environment where the [Switch]
   is. Its theorem asks of that function that the sets of closures of
   what it answers are well formed, and that what it answers refines
   the [Switch] in the states that satisfy the environment and whose
   static environment is valid ([switch_rewrite_sound]). That file
   states it of the first slice. Here it is stated of the second
   slice, [simplify_switch_arms meet rewrite], and of the third with
   nothing known of the primitives,
   [simplify_switch_merging meet rewrite [] fresh].

   What is stated.
   - [simplify_switch_arms_rewrite_sound_statement] and
     [simplify_switch_merging_rewrite_sound_statement]: each is a
     rewrite of a [Switch] that has what is asked, for a meet and a
     rewrite of [Apply_cont]s that have what the slices ask.
   - The same at the transcribed meet that the contract is proved of,
     with a join that has the contract of a join
     ([switch_arms_of_meet_to_prove_rewrite_sound_statement],
     [switch_merging_of_meet_to_prove_rewrite_sound_statement]).
   - [simplify_switch_merging_fixed_names_rename_statement]: the third
     slice with given names commutes with a renaming that fixes those
     names.

   What is assumed. Of the meet, [meet_sound] and [meet_keeps_terms],
   as in the second slice, where the first slice asks
   [meet_bottom_sound]; the transcribed meet has both, with a join
   that has the contract of a join. Of the rewrite of an [Apply_cont],
   that it is right under every environment
   ([apply_cont_rewrite_sound]); the rewrite that changes nothing is,
   and so is that of FlambdaSimplifyPassSpec.v
   ([simplify_apply_cont_sound_statement],
   FlambdaSimplifySwitchArmsSpec.v).

   Nothing known. A rewrite of a [Switch] is given the typing
   environment and no more, so the third slice is taken with nothing
   known of the primitives that have been computed: it then binds a
   primitive the first time an argument asks for it. With something
   known, what is asked is that it holds in the states that satisfy
   the environment ([known_holds_under],
   FlambdaSimplifySwitchMergeSpec.v), which a function over terms
   would have to keep as it goes; that is not here.

   Renaming. The second slice commutes with a renaming for a meet and
   a rewrite that do: that is [simplify_switch_arms_rename_statement]
   of its file, which has the form that is asked of a rewrite of a
   [Switch]. The third slice takes the names for the variables that
   it binds, and commutes with a renaming when they are renamed with
   the term ([simplify_switch_merging_rename_statement]). As a rewrite
   of a [Switch] its names are fixed, and then it commutes with the
   renamings that fix them, and with no other: a renaming that moves
   one of the names moves it in the term that is answered and not in
   the names that are given. A function over terms that needs more
   has to give names that the renaming at hand fixes.

   The proofs are in FlambdaSimplifySwitchRewriteProofs.v, which needs
   no review. *)
