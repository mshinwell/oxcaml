(* Simplifying a primitive from the types of its arguments: the first
   rewrites.

   This file is to be reviewed: the definition and the statements,
   against middle_end/flambda2/simplify/simplify_primitive.ml,
   simplify_unary_primitive.ml and simplify_binary_primitive.ml.
   Refinement relative to a typing environment is
   FlambdaTypingEnvRefinementSpec.v; the provers and what their answers
   mean are FlambdaProvers.v and FlambdaProversSpec.v; the primitives
   are ../../rocq/FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.v.

   Simplify reads the type of each argument of a primitive from its
   typing environment, asks a prover about it, and follows the answer:
   the primitive becomes a constant, or the term becomes [Invalid].
   Each statement here says that one such step is right: under a
   typing environment, the [Let] of the primitive refines the [Let] of
   the constant, or is equivalent to [Invalid]
   ([expr_refines_under], [expr_equivalent_under]). So each is about
   every state of the machine whose variables and static environment
   satisfy the environment strictly. Nothing here is a pass, or runs
   in the validator.

   What is assumed.
   - Strict satisfaction ([env_satisfies_strictly]): some valuation
     gives every name that has a value in it the type that the
     environment has for the name, and agrees with the machine on the
     variables in scope at the normal name mode. (A name that occurs
     only in types, or is out of scope, has the value that the
     valuation chooses, whatever the machine has for it.) The
     statements of the provers are of that notion, and are false of
     the one that exempts the names that hold poison (decision D26;
     FlambdaProversSpec.v says what goes wrong). After the unboxing of
     variants the environments that Simplify builds are satisfied only
     with poison exempt, and these statements do not apply there.
   - For the provers of tagged immediates and for the prover of
     physical equality, that each type asked about and the types of
     the environment are well formed ([well_formed_input],
     FlambdaProversSpec.v, which says why). Simplify makes no such
     test.
   Nothing is assumed of the kinds of the term: where an argument is
   not of the kind that the primitive takes, the primitive has no
   value and the [Let] is undefined, which anything refines; and that
   is how Simplify treats it ([let_prim_kind_mismatch_statement]).

   The type of an argument ([argument_type]) is the one that
   [Simplify_simple.simplify_simple] answers: the alias type of the
   canonical element of the argument, at the normal name mode. The
   provers expand it. [simplify_simple] and [simplify_simples] compute
   it, with the canonical element, for the functions on terms that
   are built on these statements (FlambdaSimplifyPassSpec.v);
   [well_formed_input_b] is the test of what the provers of tagged
   immediates and the prover of physical equality ask of each type
   that they are given.

   What Simplify does, and what is here.
   - [Simplify_primitive.simplify_primitive] first replaces each
     argument by its canonical element
     ([let_prim_canonical_statement]). Where the type of an argument
     is not of the kind that the primitive takes it makes the term
     [Invalid] ([arg_kind_mismatch]):
     [let_prim_kind_mismatch_statement].
     Then it looks for the primitive among those already computed (not
     here), and then asks about the types.
   - The two conclusions: a defining expression that has no value but
     one constant, in the states that satisfy the environment, may be
     replaced by the constant ([let_constant_statement]); one that has
     no value there makes the [Let] equivalent to [Invalid]
     ([let_invalid_statement]). The statements below are these two,
     with what a prover's answer says.
   - [Is_int] without [variant_only] ([simplify_is_int]): where
     [Provers.prove_is_int] proves a boolean, the primitive is that
     boolean ([let_is_int_proved_statement]). Simplify leaves the
     primitive in the term and gives its variable the type of the
     constant, so that the uses of the variable become the constant
     and the [Let], then unused, is removed. The statement is that the
     primitive may be replaced by the constant; with
     [let_simple_refines_under_statement]
     (FlambdaTypingEnvRefinementSpec.v) the body is then rewritten
     with the variable equal to the constant, as in the examples.
   - [Get_tag] ([simplify_get_tag]): where [Provers.prove_is_int]
     proves that the argument is a tagged immediate, the term is
     [Invalid] ([let_get_tag_of_immediate_statement]).
   - [Is_int] with [variant_only], [Is_null], and [Get_tag] otherwise
     ([simplify_relational_primitive]): Simplify does not ask a prover
     here. It gives the variable bound the type that says that it is
     the result of the relation on the argument, and the argument a
     type that names the variable. Three statements say that the
     value of the primitive has that type
     ([is_int_relation_type_statement],
     [is_null_relation_type_statement],
     [get_tag_relation_type_statement]); the one for [Get_tag] needs
     the tag of the block to be a tag, which the machine does not
     test and a run in range has (FlambdaTypingEnvRangeSpec.v). That
     the environment with the two equations is satisfied is for the
     statements about the meet, which adds them.
   - Then Simplify reifies the type of the variable
     ([Reification.try_to_reify], [Reify.reify]): for a type of naked
     immediates it asks [Provers.meet_naked_immediates], which reads
     the relation by asking of the type of the argument what
     [Provers.meet_is_int_variant_only], [Provers.prove_get_tag] and
     [Provers.meet_is_null] ask; if the answer is one number the
     primitive becomes that constant, and if there is none the term
     becomes [Invalid]. The statements here are of those three provers
     asked directly about the type of the argument, in the environment
     before the [Let] ([let_is_int_variant_only_statement],
     [let_get_tag_proved_statement], [let_is_null_statement]). They
     say that the conclusion is right where those provers answer; they
     do not say that this is the test that Simplify makes, which goes
     through the meet and through reification (the workstreams on meet
     and on the provers). The one for [Get_tag] needs no premise on
     tags: the prover's answer and the primitive are about the same
     block.
   - A comparison of two tagged immediates
     ([Simplify_binary_primitive], the functor [Binary_arith_like] at
     [Int_ops_for_binary_comp]): each argument is asked
     [Provers.meet_equals_tagged_immediates]. Where both answer
     numbers, and the comparison is the same number for every pair of
     them, the primitive is that number; where either answers that
     there is no tagged immediate, the term is [Invalid]
     ([let_int_comp_tagged_statement]). A comparison with a constant
     is the case where one argument is the constant, whose type has
     the one number. (Simplify gives up beyond ten numbers on a side;
     the statement has no such limit. Before it asks, it looks for a
     comparison of the result of a comparison with zero
     ([recover_comparison_primitive]): not here.)
   - [Phys_equal] ([simplify_phys_equal]): the two types are given to
     [Provers.prove_physical_equality]; where it proves that the two
     arguments are the same value, or that they are not, the primitive
     is that boolean, or the other one for [Phys_neq]
     ([let_phys_equal_statement]). A refinement: the primitive of the
     model has no value on two allocated values. (Where the prover
     does not know, Simplify records that the result is 0 or 1: not
     here.)
   - Two small terms are rewritten with these, from the environment
     that knows nothing ([example_is_int_statement],
     [example_int_comp_statement]).

   Not here: the other primitives; what Simplify records of the result
   where it does not replace the primitive (the type of the result
   variable); the equations that a relational primitive adds.

   The proofs are in FlambdaSimplifyPrimitivesProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
