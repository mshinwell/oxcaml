(* The provers, as the model sees them: the questions that Simplify asks
   of a type in a typing environment.

   This file is to be reviewed, line by line against
   middle_end/flambda2/types/provers.ml, as FlambdaTypeGrammar.v is
   against type_grammar.ml. It holds definitions only, in a module
   [Provers], so that [Provers.prove_is_int] is that function; and it
   extracts. What an answer means is FlambdaProversSpec.v. The plan of
   the workstream, with the table of the provers, is
   middle_end/flambda2/rocq/requests/T6-provers.md.

   What is here, of provers.ml (the lines are of that file):
   - the three types of answer, [meet_shortcut], [proof_of_property]
     and [generic_proof], each in a module of its name so that their
     constructors are told apart ([Proof_of_property.Proved],
     [Generic_proof.Proved], [Meet_shortcut.Invalid]), and from
     [Unknown] of FlambdaTypeGrammar.v; [as_meet_shortcut],
     [as_property], [gen_value_to_gen], [gen_value_to_proof],
     [gen_value_to_meet] (lines 41 to 103);
   - [prove_is_int_generic_value], [prove_is_int_generic],
     [prove_is_int], [meet_is_int_variant_only],
     [prove_is_not_a_pointer_generic_value], [prove_is_not_a_pointer]
     (131 to 179);
   - [prove_get_tag_generic_value], [prove_get_tag_generic],
     [prove_get_tag] (186 to 217);
   - [prove_is_null_generic], [meet_is_null] (219 to 233);
   - [prove_naked_immediates_generic], [meet_naked_immediates] (235 to
     303);
   - [prove_equals_tagged_immediates_value],
     [prove_equals_tagged_immediates],
     [meet_equals_tagged_immediates_value],
     [meet_equals_tagged_immediates],
     [meet_equals_single_tagged_immediate] (308 to 369);
   - [meet_naked_number] and the eleven functions defined with it,
     [meet_naked_float32s] to [meet_naked_masks] (371 to 520);
   - [prove_equals_to_simple_of_kind] (105 to 127);
   - [boxed_or_tagged_number], in a module of its name,
     [prove_is_a_boxed_or_tagged_number_value], [prove_nothing],
     [prove_is_a_boxed_or_tagged_number], [prove_is_a_tagged_immediate],
     the nine [prove_is_a_boxed_float32] to [prove_is_a_boxed_mask],
     [prove_is_or_is_not_a_boxed_float_value] and
     [prove_is_or_is_not_a_boxed_float] (582 to 695);
   - [prove_strings_value], [meet_strings], [prove_strings] (922 to
     933);
   - [tagging_proof_kind], [inspect_tagging_of_simple_value],
     [prove_tagging_of_simple], [meet_tagging_of_simple] (935 to 991);
   - [meet_boxed_number_containing_simple] and the nine functions
     defined with it, [meet_boxed_float32_containing_simple] to
     [meet_boxed_mask_containing_simple] (992 to 1110).
   - [variant_like_proof], [prove_variant_like_generic_value],
     [meet_variant_like], [prove_variant_like] (522 to 580);
   - [prove_unique_tag_and_size_value], [prove_unique_tag_and_size],
     [prove_unique_fully_constructed_immutable_heap_block] (697 to
     752);
   - [meet_block_field_simple_value], [meet_block_field_simple] (1112
     to 1157);
   - [prove_single_closures_entry_generic_value],
     [meet_single_closures_entry], [prove_single_closures_entry],
     [prove_code_ids_generic_value], [meet_code_ids], [prove_code_ids]
     (835 to 901);
   - [meet_project_function_slot_simple_value],
     [meet_project_function_slot_simple],
     [meet_project_value_slot_simple_value],
     [meet_project_value_slot_simple] (1159 to 1212);
   - [prove_physical_equality] (1297 to 1624);
   - [prove_alloc_mode_of_boxed_number_value],
     [prove_alloc_mode_of_boxed_number],
     [never_holds_locally_allocated_values] (1239 to 1295), of which
     nothing is stated: an allocation mode has no meaning in the
     model.
   What is not here: the provers of arrays ([meet_is_flat_float_array],
   [meet_is_non_empty_naked_number_array], [prove_is_immediates_array],
   [meet_is_immutable_array], [prove_is_immutable_array]: 754 to 833
   and 903 to 920), as the grammar has no [Array]; and [meet_rec_info]
   (1213 to 1237), which answers the expression that a head of kind
   [Rec_info] is: the grammar has the types of that kind
   ([Type_rec_info]), but their head is [unit], the expression being
   left out (FlambdaTypeGrammar.v), so there is nothing to answer.

   How the definitions differ from the compiler's.
   - A stop of the compiler is [None]. A prover expands the head of a
     type ([Expand_head.expand_head]), which is a fatal error on a name
     that is not bound and on a canonical name whose type is an alias.
     So every prover answers an [option], [None] where the compiler
     stops, and a function on heads that a prover is made with does
     too. The compiler calls [Expand_head.is_bottom] and the provers
     where the model does, in the same order, so the model stops where
     the compiler does.
   - [Expand_head.Expanded_type.descr_oub], the view of an expanded
     type that the provers match on, is here ([descr_oub], the type and
     the function): the file of [expand_head] left it out, the meet
     having no use for it. Its fifteen constructors, one for each
     kind, are five, as those of [Type_grammar.t] are in
     FlambdaTypeGrammar.v: [Naked_float32] to [Naked_mask] are the one
     [Oub_naked_number], which carries the kind. The prefix is there
     because [Value], [Naked_immediate] and the others are the kinds
     and the constants of the model.
   - A head has no [Array] (FlambdaTypeGrammar.v), so no prover has
     that case; and the nine [Boxed_float], ..., [Boxed_mask] are the
     one [Boxed_number].
   - [wrong_kind] answers its default. Its two other arguments, which
     are for the message, are left out.
   - A set of numbers ([Target_ocaml_int.Set.t]) and a set of tags
     ([Tag.Set.t]) are lists, as in the grammar: [Set.is_empty],
     [Set.inter] and [Set.get_singleton] are [Keyed.is_empty],
     [Keyed.inter Z.eqb] and [Keyed.get_singleton Z.eqb]
     (FlambdaMapSpec.v). An answer that is a set is to be compared as
     a set: the list may have a number twice, and its order is not the
     compiler's.
   - The model has no machine width. [Target_ocaml_int.bool] is 1 or 0
     ([Z.b2z]), and [Tag.to_targetint_31_63] is the number of the tag:
     the set of numbers that [prove_naked_immediates_generic] makes of
     a set of tags, by a fold, is the list of the tags.
   - [inverse_relations] is a list of pairs of a relation and a name
     (FlambdaTypeGrammar.v) where the compiler has a map from relations
     to sets of names. [prove_naked_immediates_generic] folds over the
     list from its head; the compiler folds over the relations in
     their order and, for each, over its names in theirs. The three
     local functions of [prove_naked_immediates_generic] are
     definitions before it, and the function it folds is
     [prove_naked_immediates_relation].
   - [meet_naked_number] takes the kind where the compiler takes a
     witness of it ([meet_naked_number_kind]), which has no case for
     the immediates. At [Kind_naked_immediate] it is no function of the
     compiler.
   - The provers that answer a [Simple] call
     [Typing_env.get_canonical_simple_exn] on the alias that a type is
     ([Type_grammar.get_alias_exn]) and catch [Not_found] from either:
     that is [canonical_simple_of_alias], whose inner [None] is that
     exception. The local function [inspect_immediates] of
     [inspect_tagging_of_simple_value] is [inspect_tagging_immediates].
   - The nine [prove_is_a_boxed_*] are [prove_is_a_boxed_number], and
     the nine [meet_boxed_*_containing_simple] are
     [meet_boxed_number_containing_simple], each of which takes the
     number boxed ([boxable_number]); the second takes it where the
     compiler takes the function that reads the contents of a head of
     that number.
   - A size and the index of a field are natural numbers, as in
     FlambdaTypeAccessSpec.v; the compiler has target integers.
   - [prove_variant_like_generic_value] keeps the sizes of the tags if
     every tag is scannable, by a fold that makes a map keyed by
     scannable tags; here it is a test of the tags
     ([tag_is_scannable], which is [Tag.Scannable.of_tag]) and the map
     is the same map. The function that
     [prove_unique_fully_constructed_immutable_heap_block] folds over
     the types of the fields is [field_aliases_rev].
   - A string of a [String] head is the list of its bytes
     (FlambdaTypeGrammar.v), where the compiler has a [String_info.t].
   - The local function [of_singleton_type] of
     [prove_single_closures_entry_generic_value] is
     [single_closures_entry_of_singleton], which takes the allocation
     mode.
   - [prove_code_ids_generic_value] folds over the cases of the
     closures and leaves the fold by an exception at a case that has
     no function type for its own slot. Here the function folded is
     [add_code_id_of_case], which answers [Or_unknown.Unknown] from
     there on; the fold is over the bindings of the map that count
     ([compact] of FlambdaMapSpec.v), in their order in that list; and
     a set of code ids is a list, to be compared as a set.
   - [prove_physical_equality] is in parts. Its local functions
     [incompatible_naked_numbers] and [check_heads] are
     [incompatible_naked_numbers] and [physical_equality_check_heads];
     the case of two heads that are not null is
     [physical_equality_of_heads], and that of two variants
     [physical_equality_of_variants], whose local definitions
     [immediates_equality] and [blocks_equality] are
     [physical_equality_of_immediates] and
     [physical_equality_of_blocks]; the two guards of its first two
     cases are one test, [no_immediate_and_no_block], and its last
     [match] is [physical_equality_of_parts]. The eleven cases of
     [incompatible_naked_numbers] are one, at two kinds that are the
     same. An assertion that fails is [None], as a stop.
   - The cases of two heads in [physical_equality_of_heads] are not in
     the compiler's order, and each pair of constructors is written
     once. The compiler has, before the case of two variants, a case
     for a variant whose blocks are bottom against a head that is not
     a variant; it answers as the later cases do for that pair, but
     against a mutable block, where the later case answers [Unknown]:
     that is the case of a variant and a mutable block here. Two boxed
     numbers of two kinds are the nine constructors taken two by two.
     The tests of whether two heads may be null and of whether their
     parts that are not null are known are nested here, in the
     compiler's order.
   - [Reg_width_const.equal] is [const_eqb] (FlambdaCompareSpec.v). A
     poison constant of the model has a kind and no name, so two of
     one kind are equal here, where the compiler's are equal only if
     they have one name too: of two aliases of poison constants of one
     kind and two names the compiler answers [Proved false], and this
     [Proved true]. The test that two sets of strings have none in
     common is on lists of bytes ([lists_eqb Z.eqb]).
   - A value slot of the model has no kind. The kind that
     [meet_project_value_slot_simple_value] reads off the value slot
     ([Value_slot.kind]) is an argument, the last of
     [meet_project_value_slot_simple].
   - The arguments are in the compiler's order, the environment
     first; a labelled argument is an ordinary one. *)
