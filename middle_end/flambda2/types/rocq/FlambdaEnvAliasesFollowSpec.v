(* Following aliases through a term, with the aliases of the typing
   environment: a normalisation that is an equivalence.

   This file is to be reviewed: what is known where a subterm is
   ([Known.t]) and the functions that keep it ([Known.add_equal],
   [Known.forget], [Known.bind], [Known.under_let],
   [Known.under_let_static]); [follow_aliases] and what it is made of;
   what it is for a static environment and an environment of the
   machine to agree with what is known ([known_respected]); and the
   statements.
   [follow_aliases] is written to be extracted and run by the validation
   of middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/, in the place of
   FlambdaAliasesSpec.follow_aliases, which is written with a list of
   variables and types. This one is written with the aliases of
   FlambdaEnvAliases.v (after middle_end/flambda2/types/env/aliases.ml),
   and knows the closures of a set of several functions, and the
   closures that a [Let_static] binds symbols to.

   What is known where a subterm is ([Known.t]):
   - the aliases: classes of simples that are equal, each with its
     canonical element ([Aliases.t]); with them, when each variable was
     bound ([Known.binding_times], [Known.next_binding_time]), which is
     what [Aliases.add] chooses the canonical element by;
   - the closures: for some variables, the closure that the variable was
     bound to by a [Let] ([Known.closure]): the code of a closure with
     no function slot named, or the function slot, the functions and the
     value slots of a closure of a set;
   - the closures of symbols: for some symbols, the closure that a
     [Let_static] bound the symbol to ([Known.static_closure]): the
     same, and for a closure of a set the symbols that the set names for
     its function slots.

   [follow_aliases] goes through a term and
   - replaces every [Simple] by the canonical element of its class
     ([Known.canonical_simple]), as Simplify does
     (simplify/simplify_simple.ml);
   - makes a call of a variable or of a symbol that is known to be a
     closure a direct call of its code ([canonical_call_kind]);
   - replaces the projection of a value slot from such a variable or
     symbol by what the slot holds ([canonical_project], and
     [canonical_project_from] where the projection names the function
     slot of the closure: only if it is the slot that the closure is
     at);
   - replaces the projection of a function slot from a symbol known to
     be the closure of a static set at the slot that the projection
     names by the symbol that the set names for the other slot
     ([canonical_project_function_slot]).
   There is no substitution, and a [Let] stays where it is, to be
   removed if it is then unused (../../rocq/FlambdaNormaliseSpec.v).

   Going under a [Let] ([Known.under_let]) the variable is bound
   ([Known.bind]), and then:
   - if it is bound to a [Simple], the two are made aliases
     ([Known.add_equal], with [Aliases.add] on their canonical
     elements). The variable has the latest binding time, so it is the
     one demoted, and its uses become the canonical element of the
     [Simple];
   - if it is bound to a closure, that is recorded;
   - if it is bound to the projection of a function slot from a variable
     known to be a closure of a set at the slot that the projection
     names, it is recorded to be the closure of that set at the other
     slot. This is how the closures of a set of several functions are
     all known: the compiler's [Let] of a set is a [Let] of the first
     closure and one of each other closure as its projection from the
     first (FlambdaModel.let_closures).
   Going under a [Let_static] ([Known.under_let_static]) each symbol
   that the group binds to a closure is recorded with it. What is
   recorded of a symbol stays true as the term runs on: the machine
   does not bind a symbol twice (that is undefined:
   FlambdaSemanticsSpec.eval_static_bindings), and a static environment
   only grows ([known_respected_extend_statement]). The value slots of
   a static closure are [Simple]s, read where the group is.
   Handlers of non-recursive continuations are gone into, with what is
   known where they are defined and their parameters bound; those of
   recursive ones and code are left as they are.

   Binders. In the model a binder may bind a variable that is in scope
   already, and then what was known of the variable is about another
   one. So binding a variable first forgets it ([Known.forget]):
   - of the aliases, where the variable is written in them: the
     structure is made again from the names that it has demoted, each
     with its canonical element, leaving the variable out. If the
     variable was the canonical element of a class, the other names of
     the class are made aliases of one another;
   - of the closures: the one recorded for the variable, and those, of
     variables and of symbols, with a value slot that holds it.
   Where the variable is not written in the aliases they are left as
   they are, which is the case of every binder of a term whose bound
   variables are all different. The compiler has no such operation, and
   needs none: it does not bind a variable twice. The validator applies
   [follow_aliases] to terms that its own rewrites have made, by
   inlining for one, in which a variable may be bound twice.

   What is not as in the compiler:
   - Simplify keeps a typing environment, of which the aliases are a
     part, and learns what a closure is from the type of the variable.
     Here the closures known are two lists of their own, a stand-in
     until the types of closures and the provers are used for it.
   - A symbol is known to be bound to a closure only in the body of the
     [Let_static] that binds it, and in the handlers defined there: not
     in code, and not where the term has not gone through the binding.
     Simplify has the type of a symbol wherever the symbol is used.
   - The projection of a function slot from a variable known to be a
     closure is left as it is: the variable that holds the closure at
     the other slot, if there is one, is not looked for.
   - A variable that is not bound in the term (a parameter of the code
     that the term is the body of, say) has the binding time of the
     variables of other compilation units, so that it is earlier than
     every variable that the term binds.
   - Name modes are not read: every name that the aliases answer is
     taken to be usable in a term
     ([Aliases.get_canonical_ignoring_name_mode]). What is known here
     has no variable that exists only in types.
   - Where [Aliases.add] has no answer (a fatal error in the compiler),
     or answers bottom, the aliases are left as they were.

   The statements:
   - every static environment and environment agree with knowing
     nothing, and what is known stays true when the static environment
     binds more;
   - in an environment that agrees with what is known, the canonical
     element of a [Simple] has the value of the [Simple];
   - an environment that agrees with what is known still does when a
     variable is forgotten and then bound to any value, and when the
     variable of a [Let] is bound to the value of what it is bound to;
     and the static environment that a [Let_static] makes agrees with
     what is known in its body;
   - two simples that were known to be equal, neither of them the
     variable forgotten, are still known to be equal, where the aliases
     are consistent; and they stay consistent under binders;
   - the result is equivalent to the term in every static environment
     and environment that agree with what is known
     ([follow_aliases_respected_statement]), so, starting from nothing
     known, in every environment
     ([follow_aliases_equivalent_statement]): it is not only a
     refinement, and may be applied on both sides of a comparison;
   - it commutes with renaming ([rename_follow_aliases_statement]):
     the result for a renamed term, with what is known renamed
     ([rename_known]), is the result renamed. There is no premise: the
     names of the term need not be different, as a binder forgets.

   The proofs are in FlambdaEnvAliasesFollowProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
