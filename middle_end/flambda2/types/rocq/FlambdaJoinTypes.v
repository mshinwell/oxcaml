(* The n-way join of types: the functions of
   middle_end/flambda2/types/meet_and_n_way_join.ml that join.

   This file is to be reviewed line by line against that file. It holds
   definitions only. What they are proved to guarantee is
   FlambdaJoinTypesSpec.v, against the interface with the join of
   environments that FlambdaJoinSpec.v fixes.

   The compiler that is transcribed is the one with the change that
   repairs [n_way_join_closures_entry]: the merge of the function types
   answers [None] unless both sides have a function type. The
   integration branch has taken that change; a tree that has not it yet
   has, in that merge, the cases [None, Some val2] and [Some _, None]
   that [gather_function_types_before_fix] has here. Lines are those of
   the file before the change, which moves nothing above line 2920.

   Every join function of that file is here, and the helpers that they
   call; what the model has of each is said below.

   How the compiler's functions are written here.
   - The state of the join of environments ([Join_env.t]) is any type:
     the functions are in a section whose variables are that type, the
     four functions of join_env.ml that the traversal calls
     ([Join_env.joined_env], [n_way_join_simples], [import_type] and
     [n_way_join_env_extension], the last under the name
     [join_env_n_way_join_env_extension], this file having a function
     of the same name as the compiler has), and four functions of
     other files: [Expand_head.expand_head],
     [reduce_head_of_kind_naked_immediate] (it is in
     meet_and_n_way_join.ml, with the meet), the test of structural
     equality of types that the compiler makes under
     -flambda2-join-sharing structural ([Type_grammar.equal]), and
     [Flambda_kind.Block_shape.equal].
   - A function that joins answers a ['a n_way_join_result], a pair of
     an ['a Or_unknown.t] and the state; here it answers an option of
     that, [None] being a fatal error of the compiler, an
     [assert false] or an exception that nothing catches. The header of
     each function says which. An exception that the compiler raises to
     leave a fold and catches a few lines below ([Unknown_result],
     [Cannot_track], [No_extensions], [Not_found]) is an inner [None]
     of a function that gathers a list, and is said so there.
   - The join of types calls itself through the functions that join
     the parts of types, and it is not a recursion on a type: an alias
     is expanded to a type of an environment. So the functions that
     call it are given it as [n_way_join_rec], and [n_way_join] is
     defined after them by recursion on a number that bounds the depth
     of its calls to itself; [None] is also that number run out. Every
     cycle among the compiler's functions goes through [n_way_join],
     so the others are plain definitions, but for
     [n_way_join_expanded_head], which is a recursion on its list.
   - A reference that the compiler threads through a [filter_map] or
     an [Array.init] is the state threaded through a fold. A map of the
     model is gone through in the order of its list, a map of the
     compiler in the order of its keys; no statement depends on the
     order.
   - [Join_env.machine_width] is not there: a number of the model is an
     integer whatever the machine (FlambdaModel.v).
   - A set of numbers or of strings is a list (FlambdaTypeGrammar.v);
     the union of two is their concatenation without repeats.

   What is here, in the order of the compiler's file.
   - [map_join_result] (line 49), [join_alloc_mode] (768),
     [n_way_join_unknown] (790),
     [n_way_join_head_of_kind_naked_number] (803), [deduce_is_int] and
     [deduce_is_int_simple] (867), [deduce_get_tag] and
     [deduce_get_tag_simple] (880), [n_way_join_relation_simples]
     (903): in full.
   - [generic_merge_map_known] (807): in full. Its first fold, which
     gathers the cases of each key, is [gather_known]; the
     [filter_map] with a reference is [Keyed.filter_map_fold]
     (FlambdaMapSpec.v).
   - [join_array_element_kinds] (936) is left out: the grammar has no
     arrays.
   - [n_way_join] (1885): [n_way_join_body], and [n_way_join] with the
     number that bounds its depth. The compiler stops on no type and
     on types of two kinds, whatever its flags.
   - [n_way_join_expanded_head] (1915): in full. The eleven cases of
     the naked numbers other than immediates are one, as in the
     grammar: two heads of naked numbers of different kinds are heads
     of different kinds.
   - [n_way_join_head_of_kind_value] (2108): in full. Its first
     binding, which joins the variables that say whether the value is
     null, is [n_way_join_is_null]. The compiler stops if the join of
     those [Simple]s answers a symbol.
   - [n_way_join_head_of_kind_value_non_null] (2175): the cases
     [Variant], [Mutable_block], [Closures] and [String] in full; the
     nine cases of the boxed numbers are one, as in the grammar; the
     case [Array] is left out with the arrays. The folds over the heads
     that follow the first are [gather_heads]. If the join of the
     blocks, immediates and extensions of variants is unknown, the
     relations [Is_int] and [Get_tag] that were joined before it are
     dropped, as in the compiler.
   - [n_way_join_array_contents] (2495) is left out with the arrays.
   - [n_way_join_variant] (2550): in full.
   - [n_way_join_head_of_kind_naked_immediate] (2588): in full. The
     inverse relations of the heads are dropped, as in the compiler;
     the join of environments rebuilds them. Each head is first reduced
     in the environment of its index. If every head reduces to bottom
     the compiler stops, in [create_naked_immediates_non_empty], and
     the answer here is [None].
   - [n_way_join_head_of_kind_naked_numbers]: the eleven functions
     [n_way_join_head_of_kind_naked_float32] to
     [n_way_join_head_of_kind_naked_mask] (2619 to 2661), which differ
     only in the kind.
   - [n_way_join_head_of_kind_rec_info] (2663): the head of the model
     has no content (FlambdaTypeGrammar.v), so the answer is always
     known. The compiler answers unknown if the expressions differ. So
     the compiler's answer may be unknown where the model's is known,
     never the reverse.
   - [n_way_join_head_of_kind_region] (2668): in full.
   - [n_way_join_row_like] (2678): in full, in a section whose
     variables are what its two callers give it; its local functions
     are [n_way_join_index], [n_way_join_case] and
     [n_way_join_knowns].
   - [n_way_join_row_like_for_blocks] (2806) and
     [n_way_join_row_like_for_closures] (2851): in full. The second
     stops, in the compiler, on a case for the other function slots and
     on an unknown join.
   - [n_way_join_closures_entry] (2895): in full, with the change (see
     above) in its function types.
   - [n_way_join_generic_product] (2955),
     [n_way_join_function_slot_indexed_product] (3010) and
     [n_way_join_value_slot_indexed_product] (3023): in full. The first
     fold of the first is [gather_components]. The second stops, in
     the compiler, on a component that is not of kind value: the
     product is made with [Product.Function_slot_indexed.create]
     (types/grammar/type_grammar.ml), which tests it whatever the
     flags.
   - [n_way_join_int_indexed_product] (3036): in full, with the test of
     -flambda2-join-sharing structural where the compiler tests whether
     two fields are one value in memory (decision D30). The compiler
     stops on no array of fields.
   - [n_way_join_env_extension] (3133): in full. The compiler's
     function gives the environment's the join of types and the meet;
     the environment's uses neither (FlambdaJoinSpec.v).
   - [n_way_join_function_type] (3098): a function type of the model
     has no [rec_info] (FlambdaTypeGrammar.v), so the join of the
     [rec_info]s is not there, nor the state, which only that join
     threads. A consequence for the differential tests: where every
     function type is known and all name one code, the model answers
     that code; the compiler answers unknown instead if the join of the
     [rec_info]s is unknown (their heads differ). So the compiler's
     answer may be unknown where the model's is known, never the
     reverse, and never a different code. With invariant checks the
     compiler stops on an empty list; without them it answers unknown,
     as here.
   - [n_way_join_function_types]: of [n_way_join_closures_entry], the
     part that joins the function types of the entries. A function slot
     is kept only if every entry has a function type for it, as
     [n_way_join_generic_product] does for the closures and the value
     slots, and as the binary join does ([join_closures_entry] in
     meet_and_join.ml).
   - [n_way_join_function_types_before_fix]: the same part as it was
     before the change. For each function slot that some entry has a
     function type for, it joins the function types of the entries that
     have one. An entry that has none for the slot is left out of that
     join: it is not taken to say that the code is unknown. It is not
     an upper bound (FlambdaJoinSpec.v), and is kept only as the record
     of that; nothing else is to use it.

   What was found of the compiler here: the join of types has no bound
   on its depth and no test for a cycle that is always reached
   (discrepancy T5b-1); the join of what heads say of null gives a
   variable to a head that is not null (T5b-2).

   The lists of contributors are in the order in which the compiler
   makes them (a fold from the left that conses reverses its list);
   no statement depends on the order.

   [Expanded_type], the type of expanded types and its creation
   functions, is that of the file of [Expand_head]
   (FlambdaExpandHead.v). It is given a name in this file too, where
   this file had a copy of it before that file could be imported, so
   that what is written against this file reads as it did. *)
