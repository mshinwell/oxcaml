(* Following aliases keeps scope.

   This file is to be reviewed: the statement.

   A rewrite keeps scope (FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceSpec.keeps_scope)
   if, on a term whose code is closed, the code of its result is closed
   and every variable or continuation that is free in the result is
   free in the term. ../../rocq/FlambdaKeepsScopeSpec.v says it of the
   rewrites of the validation, one statement to a rewrite, and among
   them of the [follow_aliases] of FlambdaAliasesSpec.v, which the
   validator runs today. This is the same of the [follow_aliases] of
   FlambdaEnvAliasesFollowSpec.v, which is to take its place, from
   nothing known ([Known.empty]): the statement that the validator
   needs of it when it moves.

   Why it holds: what is known where a subterm is speaks only of
   variables that are free in the term or bound around the subterm
   (the names of the aliases, and the [Simple]s of the value slots of
   the closures recorded), and a variable that is bound again is
   forgotten first ([Known.bind]). The code that a [Let_static] binds
   is left as it is, and no continuation is touched.

   The proof is in FlambdaEnvAliasesFollowScopeProofs.v, which needs
   no review; it follows the one of
   ../../rocq/FlambdaKeepsScopeProofs.v. *)
