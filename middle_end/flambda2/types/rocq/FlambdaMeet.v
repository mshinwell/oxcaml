(* The meet of two Flambda types, as functions.

   This file is to be reviewed, function by function against
   middle_end/flambda2/types/meet_and_n_way_join.ml (from
   [map_return_value] to [meet_function_type], and [meet] with
   [meet_expanded_head] as it exposes them), types/meet.ml, and the
   functions that types/flambda2_types.ml adds to [Typing_env]. It
   holds definitions only and it extracts. What the functions
   guarantee is FlambdaMeetSpec.v; the environment of a meet is
   FlambdaMeetEnv.v; expanded types are FlambdaExpandHead.v.

   The compiler has a second meet, types/meet_and_join.ml, which it
   runs by default. The two files have the same functions but for
   [meet_disjunction] and [meet_row_like], which differ in the join
   that they call. That join is a parameter here ([join], below), and
   the functions are those of meet_and_n_way_join.ml. The other file
   is not transcribed.

   The shape of the file. In the compiler the functions from [meet] to
   [meet_function_type] are one recursive definition. They do not
   recur on the types: a meet with an alias reads the type that the
   environment has for the name, and meets that. Here every cycle
   among them goes through [meet], and [meet] is given the meet of
   expanded types as a parameter, [meet_expanded_head_rec]. So each
   function is a plain definition, in a section that has that
   parameter, and one fixpoint, on a number, ties them:
   [Meet.meet_expanded_head], which gives the functions of the section
   the meet of one less. The number is the fuel; with none the answer
   is [None]. The functions that the compiler has first
   ([meet_disjunction], [meet_row_like] and the helpers), which take
   [~meet_expanded_head] as an argument there, are in the same
   section.

   The parameters, which are those of every function that is exported:
   - [join]: [Join_env.cut_and_n_way_join ~n_way_join_type
     ~meet_expanded_head ~cut_after initial_env initial_tenv
     scoped_envs], without its argument [~n_way_join_type], which is
     the join of types and is the join's own business. It is given the
     meet of less fuel. It is another workstream's (T5), and its
     contract is in FlambdaMeetSpec.v. It is to be read as the compiler
     run with [-flambda2-join-sharing structural] (decision D30).
   - [choices], a record of the three places where the meet can do
     other than the compiler does ([meet_choices], which the compiler
     has not):
     - [type_of_get_tag_scrutinee]: the type that
       [reduce_inverse_relations] gives a name of which a number among
       some tags is [Get_tag]. The compiler's is
       [blocks_with_these_tags] (FlambdaTypeGrammar.v), with which the
       step is not sound; [immediate_or_blocks_with_these_tags],
       below, is the type with which it is (FlambdaMeetSpec.v, "The
       step that is not sound").
     - [define_again]: whether a variable that the environment already
       knows is defined again, where the compiler defines the
       variables of a level in the environment that a join has
       answered ([add_defined_vars], and the extra variables of
       [meet_row_like]). The compiler does ([true]), and then the
       environment may know one variable at two binding times; with
       [false] only the variables that the environment does not know
       are defined (FlambdaMeetSpec.v, discrepancy T4-1).
     - [lift_variables_of_single_case]: [meet_row_like], where it
       keeps one case only ([need_join] is false), makes no extension
       of that case and does not record the variables that the
       environment of the case defines; the join is then given that
       one environment, and keeps of its variables those that the
       equations it joins mention. A variable that a meet inside the
       case defined, and that only the type answered mentions, is
       then not known to the environment answered. The compiler does
       not lift ([false]); with [true] those variables are defined in
       the result, as they are where there is more than one case
       (FlambdaMeetSpec.v, discrepancy T4-9).
   - the fuel.
   The compiler is [Meet.meet join compiler_choices fuel]; what is to
   be proved sound is [Meet.meet join repaired_choices fuel].

   What the model has, in the order of the file, and how each differs
   from the compiler's:
   - [map_return_value], [combine_meet_return_values], [set_meet],
     [meet_mapping], [Map_meet.meet] ([map_meet]), [meet_alloc_mode],
     [meet_unknown], [meet_or_unknown_or_bottom]: in full.
     [extract_value] is in FlambdaMeetEnv.v.
   - [combine_results]: the compiler's takes a list of meets, each of
     a type of its own, and is used with two and with three. Here
     there is a function for each, [combine_results2] and
     [combine_results3].
   - [meet_code_id]: without the code age relation, which the model's
     environment has not. Two different code ids are bottom. The
     compiler answers the newer of two that the relation relates, and
     both inputs if it cannot tell (FlambdaMeetSpec.v, discrepancy
     T4-4).
   - [reduce_head_of_kind_naked_immediate], [meet_inverse_relations],
     [reduce_inverse_relations], [meet_head_of_kind_naked_immediate]:
     in full. A set of names per relation is a list of pairs of a
     relation and a name (FlambdaTypeGrammar.v), compared as a set.
     [meet_inverse_relations] follows the path of the compiler that
     does not test physical equality.
   - [meet_head_of_kind_naked_number]: the compiler has eleven
     functions, one for each kind of naked number other than the
     immediates, each [set_meet] on the set of numbers of that kind.
     The model has one set of numbers for the eleven
     (FlambdaTypeGrammar.v) and one function.
   - [meet_head_of_kind_rec_info], [meet_head_of_kind_region]: in
     full; both answer the inputs.
   - [add_defined_vars], [meet_disjunction], [meet_row_like]: in
     full, but for the choices above and the names to avoid (below).
   - [meet_relation], [meet_variant], [meet_head_of_kind_value],
     [meet_int_indexed_product], [meet_array_of_types],
     [meet_product_function_slot_indexed],
     [meet_product_value_slot_indexed], [meet_closures_entry],
     [meet_row_like_for_blocks], [meet_row_like_for_closures]: in full.
   - [meet_head_of_kind_value_non_null]: without the case of arrays,
     which the grammar of the model has not; [meet_array_type] and
     [meet_array_contents] are not here. The cases of the boxed
     numbers are one, as the grammar has one constructor for them.
   - [meet_function_type]: without [rec_info], which the function
     types of the model have not. The compiler meets the two as types
     of kind [Rec_info], which answers the inputs and adds nothing
     unless one of them is an alias.
   - [meet_expanded_head0], [meet_expanded_head], [meet]: in full.
     [meet] is [Meet_env.meet_type] (FlambdaMeetEnv.v) with the meet
     of expanded types.
   - [Meet.meet], [Meet.meet_expanded_head], [Meet.meet_shape]
     (types/meet.ml). The compiler's [Meet.meet] catches a fatal error
     to print the two types and raises it again; that is [None] here
     as elsewhere.
   - [Flambda2_types.add_equation], [add_equations_on_params],
     [add_env_extension], [add_is_null_relation],
     [add_is_int_relation], [add_get_tag_relation]: the functions of
     the module [Typing_env] of flambda2_types.ml. The three for
     relations are one function here, [add_relation], given the two
     types. The types of the names ([Type_grammar.is_null],
     [is_int_for_scrutinee], [get_tag_for_block]) are those of
     FlambdaTypeGrammar.v where the scrutinee is a name;
     [is_null_of_simple] and the two beside it add the case of a
     constant.

   The differences that are not of one function:
   - Exceptions and references. The compiler raises [Bottom_result]
     out of a fold and catches it outside; here the state of the fold
     says so, and the rest of the fold changes nothing. [meet_row_like]
     keeps four references ([extra_variables], [result_env],
     [result_is_t1], [result_is_t2]); here they are a record that the
     functions hand on ([row_like_state]). A fatal error or an
     assertion that fails is [None].
   - The order of what is gone through. The model may not look at the
     order of names (decision D29). The cases of a row-like structure
     of blocks are gone through in the order of their tags, which are
     numbers, as the compiler does. The compiler goes through function
     slots, value slots and the names of an extension in the order of
     its maps; here they are gone through in the order in which the
     first map lists them, then those that only the second has
     ([keys_of_both], FlambdaMeetGrammar.v). The extra variables of
     [meet_row_like] are defined in the order in which the cases were
     met, where the compiler defines them in the order of the
     variables. So this file is the compiler's algorithm on maps whose
     order is not the compiler's, and it is not claimed that the two
     answer the same thing. Where the order can show: which of two
     fatal errors or of two bottoms comes first; the environment that
     one meet hands the next, and so what the next one reads; the
     binding times of variables defined after a join; the order of the
     bindings of the maps and of the equations of the levels
     answered. Giving the model its inputs with the bindings in the
     compiler's order does not remove these: the maps and the levels
     that the model builds on the way (an entry replaced, a level cut,
     an extension made of a level) are lists in the order in which
     they were built, and are gone through in that order later. No
     statement here says that the answer does not depend on the order,
     up to the order of bindings and to binding times; until one does,
     a comparison with the compiler is to be made up to those, and a
     difference beyond them is to be looked at, not assumed to be the
     order.
   - Names to avoid. The compiler's join makes variables with
     [Variable.create], which are new by construction. The model's
     join is to avoid the names of [Meet_env.names_to_avoid]
     (FlambdaMeetEnv.v) and to add those it makes. So [meet_disjunction]
     gives the second alternative the names to avoid of the first, and
     [meet_row_like] hands them from one case to the next ([avoid]);
     and the join is given those of the last. Nothing else reads them.
   - The two alternatives of [meet_disjunction]. The compiler adds the
     extensions to the environments of the two alternatives in turn
     and then meets each; here the first alternative is done, then the
     second. The two environments do not depend on each other, so the
     answers are the same.
   - Physical equality. No function here tests it (decision D30). The
     answers [Left_input], [Right_input] and [Both_inputs] are kept:
     they decide which reductions [meet_head_of_kind_naked_immediate]
     makes and whether an equation is written
     ([Meet_env.add_concrete_equation_on_canonical_name]).
   - Machine width. Numbers are integers; [Target_ocaml_int.bool] is 0
     or 1. *)
