(* The environment in which the handler of a continuation is rewritten,
   at the kinds that the handler gives its parameters.

   This file is to be reviewed: the definition and the statements,
   against middle_end/flambda2/simplify/simplify_let_cont_expr.ml and
   middle_end/flambda2/simplify/env/downwards_env.ml
   ([add_parameters_with_unknown_types]). It follows
   FlambdaTypingEnvRefinementSpec.v, whose two statements about a
   handler ([let_cont_handler_refines_under_statement],
   [let_cont_recursive_handler_refines_under_statement]) ask the
   rewrite of the handler under the parameters at every choice of
   kinds: they were written when the machine did not test the kind of
   a value where a handler binds it. It does now
   (../../rocq/FlambdaSemanticsSpec.apply_cont_value): the application
   of a handler has no step unless the arguments are of the kinds that
   the handler gives its parameters. So a function that rewrites a
   handler can do so under one environment, in which each parameter is
   defined at its kind.

   [handler_env tenv params metadata] is that environment: [tenv], the
   environment where the [Let_cont] is, with the parameters defined in
   order at the kinds of [metadata], with no types. The variables of
   the place where the handler is defined are in scope in it, and
   what was known of them there is known: a handler runs under those
   variables, whose values do not change, under a static environment
   that may have grown.

   Where the model and the compiler part:
   - The compiler knows more in a handler than this environment
     does. It rewrites the handler of a non-recursive [Let_cont] after
     the body, under the join of the environments at the uses of the
     continuation, in which a parameter has the join of the types of
     its arguments. For a recursive [Let_cont] it starts from the
     environment at the definition, as here, and gives the parameters
     of each handler unknown types
     ([add_parameters_with_unknown_types]); but the invariant
     parameters of the group have the join of the types of their
     arguments at the uses outside the handlers
     ([prepare_dacc_for_handlers]), an unknown type is of the subkind
     of the parameter and not only of its kind
     ([unknown_with_subkind]), and lifted constants and the unboxing
     of parameters add to the environment. Here there is no join of
     environments and no subkind: what was known at the definition,
     and the kind that the handler declares for each parameter.
   - [handler_env] tests, before it defines each parameter, that the
     environment passes the test of well-formedness and does not have
     the variable (FlambdaSimplifyCodeEnvSpec.define_variables_checked),
     and that the handler gives as many kinds as it has parameters.
     The compiler has no such tests. Where a test fails there is no
     environment, and the handler is to be left as it is.

   The statements:
   - the environment is satisfied where the handler runs: under the
     variables of the definition with the parameters bound to values
     of the kinds of the handler ([handler_env_satisfied_statement]);
   - the handler of a non-recursive [Let_cont] may be rewritten under
     it ([let_cont_handler_typed_statement]);
   - so may one handler of a recursive [Let_cont], if the two
     handlers agree on whether they bind something static, as in
     FlambdaTypingEnvRefinementSpec.v
     ([let_cont_recursive_handler_typed_statement]);
   - [handler_env] commutes with renaming
     ([handler_env_rename_statement]).

   Nothing else is assumed of the term or of the environment than
   what the statements say: [handler_env] answers, so that its tests
   have passed.

   The proofs are in FlambdaSimplifyHandlersProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
