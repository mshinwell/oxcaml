(* The invariant of a typing environment: what the functions that build
   an environment keep, and what the statements about meet, join and
   cutting take as a premise.

   This file is to be reviewed: the conditions, with what is said of
   where the compiler has each; the test [typing_env_well_formed]; and
   the statements. The environment is FlambdaTypingEnv.v, to be read
   against middle_end/flambda2/types/env/typing_env.ml and
   typing_env_level.ml. What satisfies an environment is
   FlambdaTypingEnvSpec.v, which has no premise on the environment;
   the invariant is about the environment alone, not about values.

   The compiler has no one statement of this. Some of the conditions
   are checked by it when invariant checks are on, some hold by the way
   its functions are written, and some are relied on with nothing that
   states them. This file is to be the one statement, for the typing
   environment, of what a well-formed environment is; the aliases have
   theirs in FlambdaEnvAliasesSpec.v, which is a part of this one.

   The conditions, and for each where the compiler establishes or
   checks it. "Stricter" marks those where the model asks for what the
   compiler does not check, or checks only under a flag (decision D32);
   each has a comment at its definition.

   Of the names and their types ([names_to_types]):
   - [binding_times_bounded], [binding_times_in_range]: the binding
     time of a variable is one that a definition gave. Holds by
     construction: [Typing_env.add_variable_definition] gives the next
     binding time and moves on; [closure_env] sets [min_binding_time]
     to the next. Nothing checks it.
   - [binding_times_distinct]: different variables have different
     binding times. By construction, for the same reason. Stricter:
     nothing checks it, and the order of the aliases relies on it
     (discrepancy T3-1).
   - [types_closed]: the variables of every type are bound. Checked by
     [invariant_for_new_equation] when invariant checks are on.
     Stricter (discrepancy T2-2). The compiler's check is of symbols
     too; here it is of variables only until the types have their free
     names.
   - [symbols_defined]: a symbol that has a type is defined. Stricter:
     nothing checks it, and [replace_equation] gives a type to any
     symbol (discrepancy T2-1).
   - [symbols_recorded]: a symbol that has a type has the binding time
     and the name mode of symbols. By construction: only
     [replace_equation] gives a symbol a type, with those. Nothing
     checks it.

   Of the levels:
   - [levels_pairwise_disjoint]: no two levels define one variable or
     have one binding time. [Typing_env_level.concat] stops with a
     fatal error otherwise, so [Typing_env.cut] checks it of the levels
     that it cuts; [add_variable_definition] refuses a variable that is
     bound only when invariant checks are on (discrepancy T2-2). With
     it [cut] always answers ([cut_defined_statement]).
   - [defined_variables_bound]: a variable that a level defines has a
     type, of the kind it was defined with. By construction:
     [add_variable_definition] gives the unknown type of the kind, and
     [Meet_env] reads the type of a name with the kind of the type it
     is about to give it ([Typing_env.find] with a kind, a fatal error
     whatever the flags if they differ). [replace_equation] itself
     checks nothing (discrepancy T2-8). This is the one condition that
     speaks of kinds, and it is of two records of one definition, the
     level's and the environment's. Nothing here is about the kind of a
     value, or the kinds of the aliases inside a type (below).
   - [levels_indexed]: the variables that a level has by binding time
     are those that it defines. Checked by [Typing_env_level.create]
     when invariant checks are on; [fold_on_defined_vars] relies on it
     whatever the flags. Stricter (discrepancy T2-2). With it
     [fold_on_defined_vars] always answers
     ([fold_on_defined_vars_defined_statement]).
   - [level_binding_times_recorded]: a variable that a level has at a
     binding time has that binding time in the environment. By
     construction: [add_variable_definition] gives the level and the
     environment the one binding time, and a new type for a variable
     leaves its binding time. Nothing checks it.
   - [level_binding_times_in_range]: the binding times of the levels
     are before the next. By construction.
   - [scopes_decreasing]: each level has a greater scope than the one
     before it. By construction ([increment_scope]).
   - [levels_agree]: the equation that the latest level has for a name
     is the type that the environment has for the name. Stricter: the
     compiler relies on it ("We rely on the fact that equations in
     later levels are more precise", [Typing_env_level.concat]) and
     nothing checks it; two things break it, a level dropping an
     equation whose type is unknown (discrepancy T2-4) and an equation
     on a variable that is not bound (discrepancy T2-1). With it the
     equations of the level that [cut] answers are the types that the
     environment has ([cut_equations_found_statement]). It is a
     proposition and not a test: it compares types, and the types have
     no test of equality yet. So the invariant
     ([typing_env_invariant]) is the test and this.

   Of the aliases:
   - [aliases_consistent] and [name_modes_recorded]
     (FlambdaEnvAliasesSpec.v, where each says how the model is
     stricter than the compiler). The order of the canonical elements
     ([canonical_elements_earliest]) is not here: [Aliases.add] does
     not keep it for two symbols (discrepancy T3-2), and a statement
     that needs it takes it as a premise.
   - [aliases_known]: the names that the aliases speak of are bound: a
     variable has a type, a symbol is defined. Stricter: nothing checks
     it; [Aliases.add] reads the binding times of its arguments from
     the environment, and takes a variable with no entry for one of
     another compilation unit.
   - [canonical_names_concrete]: a name whose type is an alias is not
     canonical. Checked by [invariant_for_alias] when light invariant
     checks are on; [Expand_head] relies on it always. Stricter
     (discrepancy T2-2).

   What is not here, and is to come: that every type is well formed
   (FlambdaTypeWellFormedSpec.v, when this file is on top of it); the
   free names of an environment and its renaming; that a name that is
   not canonical has the alias type of its canonical element, which
   nothing here needs.

   What is not here, and is not to be: that an alias inside a type is
   at the kind that the environment has for its target. The compiler
   checks that only where it follows an alias ([Typing_env.find] with a
   kind), and programs that it accepts break agreement of kinds, so it
   is a premise of the statements that need it, in a file of its own,
   and no part of the invariant.

   The statements: the test answers [true] exactly when the conditions
   hold; what the conditions give to the aliases and to [cut]; and that
   each function that builds an environment keeps the invariant, under
   what it needs. What the functions do to satisfaction is
   FlambdaTypingEnvOperationsSpec.v.

   The proofs are in FlambdaTypingEnvInvariantProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
