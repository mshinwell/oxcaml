(* That what the n-way join adds to the target fits it: the variables,
   the kinds of the aliases and the kinds of the names of equations
   of the types that the last phase of the join makes.

   This file is to be reviewed: the statements. The proofs are in
   FlambdaJoinFitsProofs.v, which needs no review.

   The meet's environment adds an extension only if it fits
   ([env_extension_fits], FlambdaMeetSpec.v): the environment knows
   the names of its equations and the variables of their types, the
   aliases of those types and the names of the equations inside them
   are of the kinds at which the types have them, and the types are
   well formed. The types of the two extensions that the join adds
   are made by [project_variables_out] (FlambdaTypeProject.v) from
   the types of the state. What is here so far is about that
   function alone, for any variables to remove and any types put for
   them:
   - the variables ([project_variables_out_scope_statement]): if the
     variables of the type that are not removed have a property, and
     so have the variables of the types put for those removed, then
     the variables of the type answered have it. (The property is to
     be "a variable of the target".)
   - the aliases ([project_variables_out_kinded_statement]): the same
     of the aliases with their kinds ([aliases_with_kinds]), where an
     alias of a variable that is removed is supposed to be at the
     kind of the type put for it. (An alias is replaced by that type
     only if the kinds agree; but a variable that holds the result of
     [Is_int], [Get_tag] or [Is_null], and a variable that an inverse
     relation is on, are replaced by what the type put for them is an
     alias of, whatever the kind of that type.)
   - the names of the equations inside the type
     ([project_variables_out_equations_kinded_statement]): the same
     of [equation_names_with_kinds]. An equation on a variable that
     is removed is dropped, so nothing is supposed of it.
   - the kind ([project_variables_out_kind_statement]): the type
     answered is of the kind of the type given.
   - well-formedness ([project_variables_out_well_formed_statement]):
     the type answered is well formed ([type_well_formed],
     FlambdaTypeWellFormedSpec.v) if the type given is and the types
     put for the variables removed are.
   Each but the kind is stated of a type and of an environment
   extension.

   And about the function that the last phase gives the projection
   for the types to put ([Join_env.expand_variable], FlambdaJoinEnv.v:
   the type kept for a variable that is removed, in which the
   variables that are removed are replaced in turn): the variables of
   a type that it answers have a property if those of the types kept
   that are not removed have it ([expand_variable_scope_statement]);
   and the type is well formed if the types kept are
   ([expand_variable_well_formed_statement]).

   And about the variables of the two extensions, for the join of
   environments up to what it adds to the target:
   - the last phase ([define_variables_in_scope_statement]): the
     equations of the two extensions that it adds are on variables
     that the target is to have, and their types mention only such
     variables: those that the source knows, those brought in, and
     those of the variables that the join has made that the phase
     defines ([in_final_target]). This is of a state whose equations
     mention only variables of the target so far
     ([equations_in_target]), and where no variable that is to be an
     alias of one that the join has made is itself one that the join
     has made ([aliases_not_made]).
   - the first phases ([first_phases_scoped_statement]): the state
     that they answer has those two properties ([state_scoped], and
     [scoped_aliases_not_made_statement]), given a join of types that
     has its contract and keeps them
     ([join_of_types_keeps_scoped]).
   - the join of types of FlambdaJoinTypes.v, given the three
     functions of the join of environments, keeps them
     ([n_way_join_keeps_scoped_statement]).
   - together ([cut_and_n_way_join0_in_scope_statement]): the
     equations of the two extensions that [cut_and_n_way_join0] adds
     are on such variables and mention only such variables.

   [in_final_target] is a set of variables read from the state of the
   join: it is what the target is to know, not what the environment
   answered knows. The functions of the meet's environment are any
   functions here, and nothing is supposed of them: that the
   environment that they answer knows these variables is for the
   statements about those functions. A symbol of an equation is said
   nothing of (the target is to know it too). And the witnesses of
   these statements (the variables kept, the two lists of equations)
   are not said to be those of the statements of
   FlambdaJoinDefineSpec.v about what the equations mean: the proofs
   take the same ones, and a statement that has both conclusions is
   still to be made.

   Not here yet: the kinds of what [Join_env.expand_variable] answers;
   and the kinds and the well-formedness of the equations that the
   state of a join holds, through the phases of the join, which is
   what would give them of the two extensions. *)
