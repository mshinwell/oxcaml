(* Simplifying a [Switch], second slice: the arms that are kept are
   simplified with what the meet has found of them.

   This file is to be reviewed: the definitions and the statements,
   against [simplify_switch] and [simplify_arm] of
   middle_end/flambda2/simplify/simplify_switch_expr.ml. The first
   slice is FlambdaSimplifySwitchSpec.v, whose notions and functions
   are used here; the contract of the meet is FlambdaMeetSpec.v; the
   function that replaces the arguments of an [Apply_cont] by their
   canonical elements is FlambdaSimplifyPassSpec.v.

   What Simplify does. For each arm it meets the type of the scrutinee
   with the type of the number of the arm, in the environment where
   the [Switch] is. Where the meet is bottom the arm is dropped: that
   is the first slice. Where it is not, the meet answers an
   environment as well, in which the scrutinee is known to be the
   number of the arm, and Simplify simplifies the arm in that
   environment: the arguments of its [Apply_cont] are replaced by
   their canonical elements there ([simplify_arm]:
   [Simplify_simple.simplify_simples] with [env_at_use]), or, where
   one arm is left, the whole [Apply_cont] is simplified there
   ([Simplify_apply_cont_expr.simplify_apply_cont]), which may do more
   than rewrite its arguments: the arm is then a use of the
   continuation that may be inlined, and the handler may take its
   place on the way up. So [switch x with 0 -> k x | 1 -> k' x]
   becomes [switch x with 0 -> k 0 | 1 -> k' 1].
   [simplify_switch_arms] here is that function as far as an arm
   stays an [Apply_cont]. The meet is a parameter, as in the first
   slice, and so is what is done to the [Apply_cont] of an arm in the
   environment of the arm ([apply_cont_rewrite]), which answers an
   [Apply_cont].

   What is stated.
   - What an arm knows ([arm_env_satisfied_statement]): a state that
     satisfies the environment of the [Switch], in which the scrutinee
     is the number of an arm, satisfies the environment that the meet
     answers for that arm.
   - Of the machine, under a typing environment
     ([switch_arms_refined_statement]): each arm of a [Switch] may be
     replaced by an [Apply_cont] that refines it in the states in
     which the arm is taken ([arm_refines_where_taken]).
   - So the arm that [simplify_arm] answers refines the arm where it
     is taken ([simplify_arm_refines_statement]), the [Switch] with
     the arms that [simplify_arms] answers refines the [Switch]
     ([simplify_arms_refines_statement]), and so does what
     [simplify_switch_arms] answers
     ([simplify_switch_arms_refines_statement]): for a rewrite of
     [Apply_cont]s that is right under every environment
     ([apply_cont_rewrite_sound]). The function of
     FlambdaSimplifyPassSpec.v is such a rewrite
     ([simplify_apply_cont_sound_statement]).
   - With the rewrite that changes nothing the functions are those of
     the first slice ([simplify_arms_identity_statement]).
   - Of the transcribed meet that the contract is proved of
     ([simplify_switch_arms_of_meet_to_prove_refines_statement]).
   - The functions commute with a renaming of variables
     ([simplify_arm_rename_statement], [simplify_arms_rename_statement],
     [simplify_switch_arms_rename_statement]), for a meet and a rewrite
     that do; the rewrite of FlambdaSimplifyPassSpec.v does
     ([simplify_apply_cont_rewrite_equivariant_statement]), and so
     does the transcribed meet that the contract is proved of, with a
     join that does
     ([simplify_switch_arms_of_meet_to_prove_rename_statement]).
   - One term ([example_switch_arms_statement]).

   What is assumed. What the first slice assumes, and its header says
   why: an environment in which a meet may be made
   ([typing_env_fits]), a static environment that is valid, strict
   satisfaction, a scrutinee that may occur in terms. And:
   - Of the meet, [meet_sound meet] (FlambdaMeetSpec.v) where the first
     slice asks [meet_bottom_sound meet]: what is used here is the
     environment that a meet answers, and [meet_sound] is what says
     that a valuation satisfies it. The transcribed meet that the
     contract is proved of has it, with a join that has the contract
     of a join ([meet_to_prove_sound_statement],
     FlambdaMeetClosuresSpec.v).
   - Of the meet, [meet_keeps_terms meet] (FlambdaMeetTermsSpec.v): a
     variable that may occur in terms under the environment that a
     meet answers may occur in terms under the environment that it was
     given. [meet_sound] does not give it: it gives a valuation that
     satisfies the environment answered and agrees with the first on
     the names that the first environment knew; the machine binds the
     variables that may occur in terms under the first environment,
     and nothing there says that it binds a variable that the meet has
     made. (The hypothesis also excludes that a variable which the
     first environment had at another name mode, or out of scope,
     comes to be in scope in terms.) The transcribed meet that the
     contract is proved of has it, with a join that has the contract
     of a join ([meet_to_prove_keeps_terms_statement], in that file),
     so the statement at that meet and the example do not suppose it.
   - Of the rewrite of an [Apply_cont], that it is right under every
     environment, in the states whose static environment is valid
     ([apply_cont_rewrite_sound]). It is asked under the environment
     that the meet answers for the arm, which is why
     [arm_env_satisfied_statement] is what the slice rests on.

   Renaming. As in the first slice, the three statements suppose
   [meet_function_equivariant meet] (FlambdaMeetRenameSpec.v), and
   here also that the rewrite commutes with the renaming of its
   environment and of the [Apply_cont]
   ([apply_cont_rewrite_equivariant]). The function of
   FlambdaSimplifyPassSpec.v does: that is
   [simplify_apply_cont_equivariant_statement] of
   FlambdaSimplifyPassRenamingSpec.v. The transcribed meet that the
   contract is proved of does, with a join that commutes with
   renaming ([meet_to_prove_equivariant_statement],
   FlambdaMeetRenameSpec.v): at that meet the equation of
   [simplify_switch_arms] has a premise on the join where it had one
   on the meet
   ([simplify_switch_arms_of_meet_to_prove_rename_statement]).

   Where the model answers nothing. As in the first slice:
   [simplify_switch_arms] is [None] where the scrutinee has no type or
   no canonical element at the normal name mode, and where a meet
   answers nothing.

   Not here: what Simplify makes of the arm that is alone where that
   is not an [Apply_cont]. A rewrite here takes an [Apply_cont] to an
   [Apply_cont], so the inlining of the continuation of that arm, and
   any other expression that
   [Simplify_apply_cont_expr.simplify_apply_cont] may answer for it,
   is not transcribed: the model has the part of that case in which
   the arm stays an [Apply_cont].

   Nor: what an arm tells its continuation. Simplify records
   each arm as a use of the continuation, with the environment of the
   arm and the types of the arguments there
   ([record_continuation_use]), and the handler is later simplified
   under the join of the environments of its uses. That is the join of
   the environments of a continuation, with the handlers. Nor: the
   arms that are removed on the way up, the merging of arms and the
   rewrites of a boolean [Switch] (the header of the first slice).

   The proofs are in FlambdaSimplifySwitchArmsProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
