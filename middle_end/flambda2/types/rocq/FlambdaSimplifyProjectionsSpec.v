(* Simplifying a load or a projection from the type of its argument:
   the rewrites to a [Simple], and the type of a block that is made.

   This file is to be reviewed: the definitions and the statements,
   against middle_end/flambda2/simplify/simplify_unary_primitive.ml
   ([simplify_immutable_block_load], [simplify_project_function_slot],
   [simplify_project_value_slot]) and simplify_variadic_primitive.ml
   ([simplify_make_block]). It follows
   FlambdaSimplifyPrimitivesSpec.v, which has the type of an argument
   ([argument_type]), the rewrites to a constant and to [Invalid], and
   what is assumed: strict satisfaction of the environment.

   Where a prover answers a [Simple] for a field of a block, for a
   closure of a set or for the contents of a value slot, Simplify
   binds the variable of the [Let] to that [Simple] instead of the
   load or the projection, and gives the variable the alias type of
   it. Each statement here says that the first of these is right:
   under the typing environment, the [Let] of the load refines the
   [Let] of the [Simple]. (The second is then
   [let_simple_refines_under_statement],
   FlambdaTypingEnvRefinementSpec.v, as in the example.) Where the
   prover answers that the type has no value to load from, the [Let]
   is equivalent to [Invalid].

   The [Simple] may occur in the term. The statements of the provers
   say that the [Simple] answered has the right value in a valuation
   that satisfies the environment; a valuation gives values to names
   that no term can mention, and agrees with the machine only on the
   variables in scope at the normal name mode
   ([agrees_in_terms], FlambdaTypingEnvSpec.v). Simplify asks the
   prover at the name mode of the variable of the [Let], which in the
   model is the normal one. What the prover answers there is the
   canonical element that the environment answers, at that name mode,
   for the alias that the type of the field, of the closure or of the
   slot is; and such an element is a constant, a symbol or a variable
   in scope at that name mode ([canonical_simple_in_terms_statement],
   [provers_answer_in_terms_statement]). So it has in the machine the
   value that the valuation gives it
   ([simple_in_terms_agrees_statement]).

   What Simplify does, and what is here.
   - [Block_load] that is not marked [Mutable]
     ([simplify_immutable_block_load0]):
     [Provers.meet_block_field_simple] is asked about the type of the
     block, at the kind that the load gives its result, which for a
     block of values is the kind value, and at the field
     ([let_block_load_statement]). A load marked [Mutable] is
     [simplify_mutable_block_load], which asks no prover, and is not
     here: the statement has the premise that the load is not marked
     so. (Every block of the model is immutable, so the rewrite would
     be right of the model for a load marked [Mutable] too; it is not
     what Simplify does, and would not be right of blocks that can be
     written.)
   - [Project_function_slot] ([simplify_project_function_slot]):
     [Provers.meet_project_function_slot_simple], asked about the slot
     projected to ([let_project_function_slot_statement]).
   - [Project_value_slot] ([simplify_project_value_slot]):
     [Provers.meet_project_value_slot_simple], asked at the kind of
     the value slot. A value slot of the model has no kind, and the
     prover's statement is of the closures whose slot has contents of
     the kind asked (FlambdaProversSpec.v, discrepancy T6-4). So the
     statement here has the premise that the projection, where it has
     a value, has one of that kind
     ([let_project_value_slot_statement]). (In the compiler the
     [Simple] answered may carry a coercion, which Simplify then
     simplifies; the model has no coercions.)
   - Where the prover answers neither, Simplify meets the type of the
     argument with a type that names the variable of the [Let]
     ([Simplify_common.simplify_projection]): not here.
   - [Make_block] of an immutable block of values
     ([simplify_make_block]): the primitive stays, and its variable is
     given the type of the blocks of that tag whose fields have the
     types of the arguments, which are aliases. The value of the
     primitive has that type ([make_block_typed_statement]), so the
     body of the [Let] is rewritten under the environment with that
     equation ([let_make_block_statement]). The tag is to be one of a
     block that is scanned, as the compiler's are; the machine makes a
     block of any tag. (Simplify also meets each argument that is a
     variable with the subkind that the primitive gives the field;
     the model has no subkinds.)
   - An example with both: the first field of a pair that was just
     made is the first argument ([example_first_of_pair_statement]).

   Not here: [Unbox_number] and [Untag_immediate], which Simplify
   treats through the meet; the symbol projections and the equations
   of common subexpressions that Simplify records at a load.

   The proofs are in FlambdaSimplifyProjectionsProofs.v, which needs
   no review. *)

   holds a naked float, answers [Invalid], and the projection has
