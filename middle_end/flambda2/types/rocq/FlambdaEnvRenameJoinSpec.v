(* The join of typing environments under a renaming of variables: the
   source of new names, and the action of a renaming on what the join
   holds.

   This file is to be reviewed: the definitions and the statements.
   The join is FlambdaJoinEnv.v, put together with the join of types
   and the meet in FlambdaJoinMeet.v; the renaming of types is
   FlambdaTypeRenameSpec.v and that of typing environments
   FlambdaEnvRenameSpec.v. The contract of the join, FlambdaJoinSpec.v
   and the files beside it, does not speak of renaming.

   The compiler has no such statement: its join is not given renamed
   environments, and a variable that it makes ([Variable.create])
   differs from every other by construction. It is here because every
   function of the model that reads names is to commute with renaming
   (NAMES.md, section 7), and the meet of types, which is stated to
   commute with renaming for a join that does, calls this join.

   The join makes variables. The model's is given a source of new
   names, [Join_env.fresh], a function from the names to avoid to a
   name that is not one of them, and calls it in one place
   ([Bindings_in_target_env.existential_for_these_simples]). The
   variables that it makes are defined by the environment that it
   answers, so they show in its answer.

   No function from lists of variables to variables commutes with
   every renaming ([no_source_commutes_statement]): the empty list is
   left as it is by every renaming, and no variable is. So the join
   with one source of new names does not commute with every renaming,
   whatever the source is. This is not a defect of the source that the
   model uses (FlambdaNameAbstractionSpec.fresh_name), and another
   would not do better.

   What is stated instead: a renaming acts on the source of new names
   too, and the join with the renamed source, of the renamed
   arguments, answers the renamed answer. The renamed source
   ([rename_fresh]) undoes the renaming on the list that it is given,
   asks the source, and renames the name that the source answers; this
   is the action of a renaming on a function. It is said here as a
   relation between two sources, [fresh_related r fresh fresh']: on a
   renamed list, [fresh'] answers the renamed answer of [fresh]. The
   two say the same ([rename_fresh_related_statement],
   [fresh_related_unique_statement]); the relation needs no inverse
   and no equality of functions. A source related to one that avoids
   the names it is given avoids them too
   ([fresh_related_avoids_statement]).

   The other things that the join is given are related in the same
   way. Its parameters ([parameters_related]): the two tests of
   equality answer the same of renamed types and of renamed
   extensions, the type of a constant is renamed, the depth is the
   same. The model's parameters, with the source renamed, are related
   to the model's parameters ([join_parameters_related_statement]):
   its tests of equality do not see a renaming and the type of a
   constant holds no variable.

   The action of a renaming on what the join holds, which is to be
   reviewed: a vector of [Simple]s across the joined environments
   ([rename_simples_in_joined_envs]: the indices are kept); the
   candidate for the canonical [Simple] of a vector
   ([rename_candidate]); the names of the target
   ([rename_bindings_in_target_env]: the source environment, the
   variable made for each vector, with the vector, the variables
   imported and made, with their kinds, and the names to avoid); the
   joined environments ([rename_joined_envs]: each environment and the
   equations of the level cut from it, on both sides); the aliases of
   the variables made ([rename_aliases_of_existentials]); and the
   state of the join ([rename_join_env]: every variable in it, where
   it is a key as where it is in a type). Indices, kinds and symbols
   are kept.

   Statements, beside those of the source: the one function that
   calls the source, and the function of the state that calls it,
   answer the renamed variable and the renamed state when the sources
   are related ([existential_for_these_simples_renamed_statement],
   [existential_for_these_canonicals_renamed_statement]). These are
   where a variable is made. The other functions of the join make no
   variable and compare variables by equality and by binding time
   only; that each gives the renamed answer on renamed arguments is in
   the Proofs file as lemmas, one for a function, named after it.

   The join of environments is handed two more functions of its
   state: the join of types and the choices of the model. What it is
   for a renaming to relate two of each is defined
   ([n_way_join_type_related], [choices_related]), and the choices
   that the model has, the compiler's and the repaired ones, are
   related to themselves ([compiler_choices_related_statement],
   [repaired_choices_related_statement]). The join of types that the
   model gives the join of environments is related to itself where
   the parameters are related
   ([n_way_join_of_types_related_statement]): the traversal of types
   (FlambdaJoinTypes.v) makes no variable, and what it calls of the
   state does as the statements above say.

   The equation of the join as a whole is the last statement
   ([cut_and_n_way_join_related_statement]): the join that the meet
   calls ([Join_env.cut_and_n_way_join]), where everything that it is
   given is related, answers of the renamed environments the renamed
   answer. That join is written for any functions of the environment
   of the meet ([Join_env.meet_env_functions]) and any type of meets
   of expanded types, so the statement is for any action of the
   renaming on the environments of the meet and any relation between
   two meets of expanded types under which the functions are related
   ([meet_env_functions_related], which is to be reviewed). That the
   functions of the model's meet are so related, at the action and the
   relation of FlambdaMeetRenameSpec.v, is not stated here.

   The join that Simplify calls answers an analysis as well: the
   definitions of the variables that the join made, and the
   identifiers that the caller gave the environments. A renaming acts
   on the definitions and keeps the identifiers ([rename_analysis],
   which is to be reviewed). The same equation is stated of that join
   ([cut_and_n_way_join_with_analysis_related_statement]) and of the
   function of types/join_levels.ml that Simplify calls
   ([join_levels_cut_and_n_way_join_related_statement]), and what
   Simplify reads of an analysis is read renamed of the renamed
   analysis ([analysis_read_renamed_statement]).

   What this does not say: that the join with one source of new names
   answers, of renamed arguments, the answer renamed up to the
   variables that it made. That follows from the equation with the
   renamed source and one more fact, that two sources of new names
   give answers that differ by a renaming of the variables made; that
   fact is not stated.

   The proofs are in FlambdaEnvRenameJoinProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
