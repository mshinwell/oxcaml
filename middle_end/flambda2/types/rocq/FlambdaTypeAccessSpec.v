(* What the provers and reification read of a type: the functions of the
   grammar that look into a row-like structure or an entry of closures.

   This file is to be reviewed: the definitions, against
   [Type_grammar.Row_like_for_blocks.all_tags], [all_tags_and_sizes],
   [get_singleton] and [get_field],
   [Type_grammar.Row_like_for_closures.get_single_tag], [get_closure]
   and [get_env_var], and [Type_grammar.Closures_entry.find_function_type];
   and the statements.

   These are the functions through which provers.ml and reify.ml read
   the blocks and the closures of a type, once [Expand_head] has given
   them a head. Each has here a statement of what its answer says of a
   value of the type, so that the provers can be stated from these and
   need not go back to the meaning of types.

   How the definitions differ from the compiler's.
   - A size and the index of a field are natural numbers; the compiler
     has target integers.
   - [all_tags_and_sizes] is written with a test of the cases and not
     with a flag that a function over the map sets.
   - [get_single_tag] stops the compiler when the one case has an
     exact index without the function slot of the case. Here it
     answers [None] there, and a well-formed type has no such case
     ([get_single_tag_well_formed_statement]).
   - A map is read by [lookup], so a binding that is shadowed is not
     seen: the keys of a map are its domain, and its one binding, if
     it has one, is that of the one key bound.

   What an answer is not. [get_singleton] and [get_single_tag] drop the
   environment extension of the case, as the compiler does (it holds
   that what the extension says is in the environment by then). The
   statements say what holds of a value of the type, of which the
   extension holds too; they do not say that a value with what is
   answered has the type.

   One answer rests on well-formedness.
   [find_function_type] with [exact] answers [Bottom] when the entry
   has no function type for the slot. A prover reads that as "the type
   has no value" ([Provers.prove_single_closures_entry]). That is
   right of a well-formed type only, in which an exact case has a
   function type for each function of its index, the slot of the case
   among them (condition 8 of FlambdaTypeWellFormedSpec.v):
   [find_function_type_exact_statement] says that the answer is then
   never [Bottom]. Of a type that is not well formed the reading is
   wrong: the meaning does not ask an entry to have a function type.

   The proofs are in FlambdaTypeAccessProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
