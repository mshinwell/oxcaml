(* The aliases of the typing environment: what the structure means, the
   order that chooses the canonical element of a class, and what the
   queries answer.

   This file is to be reviewed, with FlambdaEnvAliases.v, against
   middle_end/flambda2/types/env/aliases.ml and aliases.mli. In
   FlambdaEnvAliases.v, read against the OCaml: the type [Aliases.t], the
   order ([Aliases.name_defined_earlier], [Aliases.defined_earlier]) and
   the three functions that give a name its binding time and name mode
   ([Aliases.binding_time_and_name_mode], [Aliases.compute_name_mode],
   [Aliases.compute_name_mode_unscoped]). The queries and [Aliases.add]
   are written there as the OCaml is, but need not be read: what they
   answer is stated here. Binding times and name modes are
   FlambdaBindingTime.v.

   The structure. The simplifier learns that a name is equal to another
   name or to a constant (an [Equals] type), and keeps what it has
   learnt as classes of simples that are known to be equal, each with a
   canonical element. [Aliases.t] holds, for each name that is not the
   canonical element of its class (a name that has been demoted), its
   canonical element ([canonical_elements]), and the same the other way
   round, for each canonical element the names demoted to it
   ([aliases_of_canonical_names] and [aliases_of_consts]). A simple that
   the structure does not speak of is alone in its class.

   What it means ([aliases_respected]). The structure is a claim about
   the values of names when the program runs: an environment of the
   machine respects it when every name that has been demoted has the
   value of its canonical element.
   - The value of a simple is what [eval_simple] gives: a constant is
     its own value; a symbol is a pointer, a value by itself, whether
     or not the static environment binds it; a variable has the value
     the environment binds it to, and none if it binds it to nothing.
     So the static environment is not needed.
   - Values are compared as [eval_simple] gives them, a value or none.
     A variable aliased to a constant or to a symbol is therefore bound
     to it; two variables that are aliased are bound to the same value,
     or neither is bound. That every name the typing environment knows
     has a value is not said here: the names that exist only in types,
     or are out of scope, have none at run time, and the typing
     environment says what stands for their values
     (FlambdaTypeMeaningSpec.v, "The environment").
   - The values are those of the machine, and equal means the same
     value: a variable that holds a closure made by a [Let] is not
     equal to a symbol bound to a closure of the same code and slots.
   - Respect asks the same of the two inverse maps: a name listed among
     the aliases of a canonical element has its value. The three maps
     agree when the structure is consistent ([aliases_consistent]), and
     then this adds nothing; it is asked so that what a query answers
     has the value of what it was asked about with no condition on the
     structure ([respected_canonical_at_mode_statement]).

   The order ([Aliases.defined_earlier]). The canonical element of a
   class is its earliest element: a constant before any name; a symbol
   before any variable; of two variables the one bound first, by the
   binding times of the typing environment. The statements of the
   section "The order" say this of the function. Two symbols are not
   ordered, nor are two variables with the same binding times.

   What is stated of the queries:
   - [Aliases.get_canonical_ignoring_name_mode] answers the canonical
     element of the class ([canonical_element_of]), which is not itself
     demoted, is earlier than every other element of the class, is the
     constant of the class if it has one, and is not a variable if the
     class has a symbol;
   - [Aliases.get_canonical_element_exn] answers the canonical element
     if it may be used at the name mode asked for, and failing that an
     alias that may; what it answers is in the class of what it was
     asked about, and may be used at that name mode. Which alias: one
     of the least name mode that will do, and of those one that no other
     is earlier than ([earliest_alias_statement]); and there is no
     answer only if no alias may be used ([no_alias_statement]).

   Differences from the OCaml, all deliberate.
   - Coercions. A [Simple] of the model has no coercion
     (FlambdaModel.v), so the model's classes are of simples that are
     equal, where the OCaml's are of simples equal up to a coercion,
     and keep beside each alias the coercion to its canonical element.
     A coercion changes only the depth of recursion recorded for a
     closure ([Coercion.t] is [Id] or [Change_depth]), which the machine
     does not have: a simple and its coercion have the same value. So
     respect loses nothing. What is not modelled: that the coercions
     are composed and inverted correctly; the fatal errors of
     [Coercion.compose_exn] and of adding an alias of an element to
     itself with a coercion that is not the identity.
   - One compilation unit. [Aliases.name_defined_earlier] leaves out
     the comparison of the compilation units of two variables that have
     the same binding time, and goes to the last step, the binding
     times that [binding_time_resolver] gives. That function is total
     here. In the compiler it may raise ([Binding_time_resolver_failure],
     which [Typing_env] catches, dropping the alias), and for a name of
     the current unit it stops with a fatal error.
   - [Aliases_of_canonical_element.t] is one map from each alias to the
     name mode it had when it was demoted. The OCaml's record has
     [aliases], these names grouped by name mode, and [all], the names;
     its invariant that the two agree has nothing to say here.
   - The three maps of [Aliases.t] are kept as the OCaml has them, and
     not replaced by the one that determines the others, so that the
     functions read as the OCaml's do. That they agree is the condition
     [aliases_consistent], which is not checked by the OCaml's
     [invariant].
   - Maps are association lists of which the first binding of a key
     counts (FlambdaMapSpec.v): where the OCaml replaces a binding, the
     model adds one in front.
   - Fatal errors. Two of the OCaml's are not guarded by a flag: adding
     to the aliases of a canonical element a name that is there, and
     demoting a constant. The functions that can meet one answer an
     option, and [None] is the fatal error. The checks that the OCaml
     makes only under a flag ([invariant], [invariant_add_result], and
     assertions) are not made by the model's functions; the first two
     are functions of their own, [Aliases.invariant] and
     [Aliases.invariant_add_result], that answer whether the check
     passes.
   - [Not_found] is [None].
   - Where several aliases are equally early, [find_earliest_alias]
     takes in the OCaml the one that an order on names
     ([Name.compare]) puts first, and here the first of a list. The
     model has no such order; there is at most one earliest alias when
     the variables have different binding times.
   - Not modelled yet: the rest of [Alias_set] ([inter], [filter],
     [find_best], [get_singleton], [choose_opt]) and [add_alias_set].
     [print] is not modelled.

   What is stated of [Aliases.add], which is given two canonical
   elements found to be equal:
   - what it answers ([add_result_statement]): the canonical element of
     the merged class and the name demoted are its two arguments, the
     later of them demoted; bottom exactly for two different constants
     ([add_bottom_statement]); neither of the model's two fatal errors
     for two different canonical elements of a consistent structure
     ([add_defined_statement]), which says nothing of the compiler's
     resolver, total here;
   - the classes afterwards ([add_canonical_element_statement],
     [add_aliased_statement]): the two classes are merged and the
     others are as they were;
   - an environment that respects the structure and gives the two the
     same value respects the result ([add_respected_statement]);
   - the invariant is kept, part by part: consistency always, the name
     modes recorded always, the order only if one of the two arguments
     is earlier than the other ([add_earliest_statement], and the
     question there).
   And of [Aliases.get_aliases]: a simple is in the set exactly when it
   is known to be equal to the element asked about
   ([get_aliases_statement]).

   [aliases_well_formed] is the invariant that the statements use. It
   asks more than the compiler checks, and each of its parts says so
   where it is defined. FlambdaEnvAliasesInvariantSpec.v has it as a
   test, and says what [Aliases.invariant] and
   [Aliases.invariant_add_result], the model's copies of the checks that
   the OCaml makes under a flag, answer for a structure that has it.
   FlambdaEnvAliasesRenamingSpec.v has the renaming of the structure,
   its free variables, and that the functions commute with renaming.

   The proofs are in FlambdaEnvAliasesProofs.v, which needs no review. *)

   compilation unit, and for the unit being compiled it stops with a

   the unit being compiled having different binding times, which
   nothing there states or checks. The model asks for it: that
   different variables have different binding times is a part of the
   invariant of the typing environment, which the Spec file of the
   typing environment states, and there the model is stricter than the
   compiler (decision D32). It is not certain that the compiler's
   environments have it: a comment in [Typing_env_level.concat] says
   that a join may give several variables one binding time.
