(* What the n-way join of types guarantees: the type traversal of the
   join, against the join of environments.

   To be reviewed: every definition and statement of this file, with
   the section "The join of types, inside a join of environments" of
   FlambdaJoinSpec.v, which is the interface that this file is written
   against and does not change. The functions are FlambdaJoinTypes.v,
   a transcription of the join functions of
   middle_end/flambda2/types/meet_and_n_way_join.ml.

   What is proved is one thing ([n_way_join_sound_statement]): the join
   of types meets [n_way_join_type_sound], the contract that the join
   of environments assumes of the join of types that it is given, as
   that file states it, whatever the number that bounds its depth. With
   it ([n_way_join_bound_is_met_statement]): where the join answers a
   type, a value of a type given, under a valuation that satisfies its
   input, has the type answered under some valuation of the target
   that extends it, so that the upper bound is not said of nothing.
   This file also states the same contract of the functions that join
   heads with no types inside them, each in its own form
   ([flat_heads_sound_statement]); the same of every other function of
   the traversal is proved on the way, and stated with its proof.

   How it is stated. The functions of the traversal thread the state of
   the join of environments, of which this file knows what
   FlambdaJoinSpec.v says and no more: three readings, two invariants,
   and the contracts of the functions of the environment side that the
   traversal calls. Each function of the traversal is given a list of
   things (types, heads, cases, [Simple]s), each with the index of the
   environment in which it holds, and answers one thing and a state.
   [join_step_sound] says of such a function what [n_way_join_type_sound]
   says of the join of types, in the same words: the invariant is kept,
   the state grows, the answer mentions only variables of the target,
   the answer is an upper bound of each thing given, under any valuation
   of the target that extends that of its index, and the answer is
   kinded in the target if the state is kinded. What "upper bound"
   means depends on the things: for types, that a value that has the
   one has the other. The contract of the join of types says one thing
   more, which is of types only and which [join_step_sound] does not
   say: the type answered is of the kind of each type given. It is
   proved of the join of types itself, with the rest of its contract.

   The join of types is not a recursion on a type: when it is given an
   alias and something that is not one it expands the alias, to a type
   of an environment, which is no part of the types that it was given.
   So the functions are defined with a number that bounds the depth of
   the calls of the join of types to itself, and what is proved of the
   join of types is proved by induction on that number. An answer of
   [None] is the number run out, or a fatal error of the compiler; it
   is never a refusal of something that the compiler answers.

   What is assumed. Nothing here is an axiom; what a statement needs of
   another file's functions is a premise of it, a named proposition of
   this file:
   - [environment_side_sound]: the four statements of FlambdaJoinSpec.v
     about the functions of the environment side. The owner of the join
     of environments proves them of its functions. The first, that a
     valid state has witnesses, is used by the second statement only.
   - [reduce_head_of_kind_naked_immediate_sound]: a number that has a
     head of naked immediates, under a valuation that satisfies an
     environment strictly, has the head as the function reduces it in
     that environment; in particular the function does not answer
     bottom. The owner of the meet proves it. It is true because a
     relation [Is_int] or [Get_tag] is never true of a scrutinee that
     holds poison (decision D26, as amended; [relation_holds] of
     FlambdaTypeMeaningSpec.v).
   - [expand_head_sound]: a value that has a type has the type as
     [Expand_head] expands it, under a valuation that satisfies the
     environment strictly; the expanded type is in the scope of the
     environment and kinded there, where the type is; and it is of the
     kind of the type, if the type is kinded and the environment has
     [constants_of_kind] (FlambdaTypingEnvKindedSpec.v). The owner of
     the meet proves it.
   - [joined_envs_constants_of_kind]: in each environment joined, a
     constant that is the canonical element of a [Simple] of a kind is
     of that kind ([constants_of_kind]). It is a premise about kinds,
     beside [joined_envs_kinded] of the contract and, like it, no part
     of the well-formedness of environments. [Expand_head] answers the
     type of such a constant whatever the kind of the alias
     (discrepancy T4-7), so without it the join of aliases of one kind
     could be a type of another. It follows from [joined_envs_kinded]
     where the well-formedness of environments has their aliases
     consistent: an environment that is kinded has its aliases of one
     kind ([aliases_kinded] of that file). This file is for any
     well-formedness, so it is asked here;
     FlambdaJoinTypesWithEnvSpec.v, which is at the invariant of
     typing environments, does not ask it. (A condition of structure
     would give it too, that the type an environment has for a name
     that is not canonical is the alias type of its canonical element;
     the compiler's environments do not all have that one: a later
     demotion of the canonical element leaves the type as it was, and
     discrepancy T4-10 is another way.)
   - [type_eqb_sound] and [block_shape_eqb_sound]: two types that the
     test of structural equality identifies have the same values, and
     two shapes that the test of shapes identifies are one shape. The
     tests of FlambdaTypeEqualSpec.v have them.

   What is found of the compiler on the way is said at the function
   concerned, in FlambdaJoinTypes.v, and recorded as a discrepancy
   (T5b-1 and after; R1-16 and X3-5 are met here too). *)
