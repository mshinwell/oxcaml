(* The n-way join of types with the functions of the join of
   environments: the two halves of the n-way join put together.

   To be reviewed: the definition and the three statements of this
   file.

   FlambdaJoinTypesSpec.v says what the type traversal guarantees
   against an interface (FlambdaJoinSpec.v): of the state of the join
   of environments it knows three readings and two invariants, and of
   the functions of the environment side it knows their contracts.
   FlambdaJoinEnvSpec.v says that the functions of FlambdaJoinEnv.v
   meet those contracts, at its own readings and invariants of the
   state and at the invariant of typing environments
   (FlambdaTypingEnvInvariantSpec.v). This file puts the two together.
   [n_way_join_of_types] is the join of types that is given those
   functions and the two tests of equality of FlambdaTypeEqualSpec.v;
   it is what the join of environments is to be given for its rounds.
   The first statement is that it meets the contract of the join of
   types ([n_way_join_type_sound], FlambdaJoinSpec.v) at those readings
   and invariants, whatever the two numbers that bound the recursions.
   The second, which has no premise, is that it keeps the definitions
   of the state ([join_of_types_keeps_definitions],
   FlambdaJoinEnvSpec.v), which the statements about the rounds of the
   join of environments suppose of the join of types that they are
   given: it is the statement of FlambdaJoinTypesKeepsSpec.v, said of
   this function. The third is the first at another invariant of the
   state, [state_true source] (FlambdaJoinStateSpec.v), which says what
   the state means (the equations of the target made so far are true
   at every input, for a join whose source is [source]) and not only
   what its names are. It is the hypothesis under which the rounds of
   the join of environments are proved to keep the equations true
   ([first_phases_true_statement] of that file). Its premises are
   those of the first and one more, [parameters_type_eqb_sound]: it is
   about the equality of types that the join of environments is given
   for its own use, which is not the equality that the traversal
   uses.

   What is still assumed, each a premise of the first statement:
   - of [Expand_head] and of the reduction of heads of naked
     immediates, what FlambdaJoinTypesSpec.v assumes of them
     ([expand_head_sound], at the invariant of typing environments,
     and [reduce_head_of_kind_naked_immediate_sound]). They are
     functions of the workstream on meet, whose files are not under
     this one, and stay arguments of [n_way_join_of_types];
   - what the theorems about the functions of the environment side
     assume (FlambdaJoinEnvSpec.v): [fresh_avoids], of the source of
     new names, and [env_extension_eqb_sound], of the equality of
     extensions that the join of environments is given.

   What is assumed in FlambdaJoinTypesSpec.v and not here:
   - the premise about the constants of the environments joined
     ([joined_envs_constants_of_kind]). The invariant of typing
     environments has the aliases of an environment consistent, an
     environment that is kinded and has consistent aliases has
     [constants_of_kind] (FlambdaTypingEnvKindedSpec.v), and the
     environments joined are kinded by a premise of the contract;
   - what is assumed of the two tests of equality: those of
     FlambdaTypeEqualSpec.v have it.

   The proofs are in FlambdaJoinTypesWithEnvProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
