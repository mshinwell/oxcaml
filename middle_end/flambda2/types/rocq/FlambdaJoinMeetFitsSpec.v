(* The types of the equations that the join adds fit the environment
   of the meet: what FlambdaJoinMeetSpec.v leaves as a premise
   ([types_fit_otherwise], [join_adds_types_that_fit_otherwise]) is
   true of the join put together in FlambdaJoinMeet.v.

   This file is to be reviewed: the statements. The proofs are in
   FlambdaJoinMeetFitsProofs.v, which needs no review.

   An extension that the environment of the meet is given is supposed
   to have types that are well formed and in which the names of the
   equations inside them are of the kinds of their types
   ([type_fits], FlambdaMeetSpec.v, with the variables and the aliases
   that FlambdaJoinMeetSpec.v has). Of the two extensions that the
   last phase of the join adds:

   - the types are well formed: FlambdaJoinWellFormedSpec.v, for the
     state that the first phases answer and for what the last phase
     makes of it;
   - the names of the equations inside the types are of their kinds
     in the target, by the kinds that the bindings of the state
     record: FlambdaJoinEquationNamesSpec.v. Here: so they are in the
     environment of the meet in which the variables of the target
     are defined ([last_phase_equation_names_known_statement]), as
     [last_phase_kinds_known_statement] (FlambdaJoinMeetSpec.v) says
     of the aliases, and under its premises;
   - so the join that the meet calls adds types that fit otherwise
     ([model_join_adds_types_that_fit_otherwise_statement]), and has
     the conclusions of the contract that the meet has for its join
     that are not about values, with no premise left about the join
     itself ([model_join_scoped_envs_keeps_outright_statement]:
     [model_join_scoped_envs_keeps_statement] of FlambdaJoinMeetSpec.v
     with its premise discharged). The same of the conclusion about
     values that FlambdaJoinMeetSpec.v has on the runs that have its
     conditions ([model_join_scoped_envs_satisfied_outright_statement]:
     [model_join_scoped_envs_satisfied_statement] with its premise
     about the join discharged, and nothing else changed).

   The expansion of heads that the join of types is given has what
   the join of types supposes of it for the names of equations
   ([expand_head_for_join_equations_kinded_statement]).

   The same of the join that Simplify calls ([model_join]), in a
   section of its own. The statements of FlambdaJoinMeetSpec.v about
   it have the premise [types_fit_otherwise] for the run that they
   name.
   Here it follows from their premises about the inputs and one
   more, [uses_fit_otherwise]: the types of the uses that are joined
   are well formed and have the names of their equations at their
   kinds ([model_join_run_adds_types_that_fit_otherwise_statement]).
   So that join has five of the six parts of [join_guarantees]
   (FlambdaJoinSpec.v) with no premise about a run: the four that
   are about the target ([model_join_keeps_outright_statement]) and
   what the analysis speaks of
   ([model_join_describes_uses_outright_statement]). What stays a
   premise of the two: that the meet of expanded types of the model
   has the half of what the meet's contract for its join supposes of
   the one it is given that is not about values
   ([meet_expanded_head_keeps]). The sixth part, about values, is
   had on the runs that have the conditions, of that join made with
   any meet of expanded types that has both halves
   ([model_join_with_admits_use_outright_statement]); it is not
   stated at the meet of the model, which is not shown to have the
   half about values and may not have it.

   The meet of the model has the half of that which is not about
   values ([meet_expanded_head_keeps]), for the choices of the meet
   that its contract is proved of
   ([model_meet_expanded_head_keeps_statement]): the meet has it at
   every fuel from a join that has the conclusions of its contract
   that are not about values (FlambdaMeetKeepsSpec.v), and the join
   of the model has them outright (above). So the join that Simplify
   calls has those five parts of [join_guarantees] under premises
   about its inputs and the choices of the meet only
   ([model_join_guarantees_on_inputs_statement]): nothing is supposed
   of a function of the model. And the meet of the model, with
   such choices, adds no variable that may occur in terms
   ([model_meet_keeps_terms_statement]: [meet_keeps_terms],
   FlambdaMeetTermsSpec.v, which is what the simplification of a
   [Switch] supposes of the meet that it is given,
   FlambdaSimplifySwitchArmsSpec.v). *)

(* CR mshinwell: the contract of the join (FlambdaJoinSpec.v) does not
   suppose this of the uses, as it does not suppose that a meet may be
   made in the source. It is supposed here because the join puts
   types of the uses, and joins of them, into the target, and a meet
   may be made in the target only if those are well formed and have
   the names of their equations at their kinds. Whether every
   environment that Simplify gives the join has it is not known. *)

(* And the join that Simplify calls, with such choices of the meet,
   has five of the six parts of [join_guarantees] (FlambdaJoinSpec.v)
   under premises about its inputs only: the conclusions of
   [model_join_keeps_outright_statement] and of
   [model_join_describes_uses_outright_statement], without their
   premise about the meet. (That a meet may be made in the target
   says that the target has the invariant of typing environments and
   no bottom type, the first two parts.) The sixth part,
   [join_admits_use], is not here: see
   [model_join_with_admits_use_outright_statement]. *)
