(* The environment side of the n-way join: what is stated of the
   functions of FlambdaJoinEnv.v.

   To be reviewed: every definition and statement of this file. The
   contract of a join is FlambdaJoinSpec.v; this file is about the
   transcription of the compiler's join.

   What is here so far:
   - [compiler_join]: the transcription of the join that Simplify
     calls, as a join of environments in the sense of the contract.
     [repaired_join]: the same with another test for recovering
     relations ([Join_env.repaired_choices]), which is not the
     compiler's.
   - Of the rounds, whatever the test: a relation is recorded only on
     a variable for which the test answered [true]
     ([round_records_where_chosen_statement] and the two that follow).
     Of the repaired test: such a variable has a value at every use,
     in a run that binds the variables of terms
     ([repaired_test_gives_values_statement],
     [repaired_rounds_scrutinees_have_values_statement]). On the
     instance below, the repaired join admits both uses
     ([witness_repaired_join_admits_statement]).
   - The state of a join (the last section): the readings that the
     interface with the join of types asks for, a first invariant
     ([state_valid], about the names of the state), and, of the three
     functions that the join of types calls, the parts of their
     contracts that are not about kinds.
   - Kinds, and the contracts (the section after it): [state_kinded],
     and that those three functions meet their contracts
     ([n_way_join_simples_sound_statement] and the two after it).
   - That those three functions keep the definitions of the state at
     every state, with no premise (the last section).
   - An instance, [Witness], that shows that the transcription has not
     the strict contract ([sound_join_of_environments]): two uses in
     which a variable [x] that exists only in types has a type that
     says that [r] holds whether [x] is null (at the first use [x] may
     be null or not, at the second it is null); a run through the
     first use in which [x] has no value and [r] holds 0. The join puts the
     relation back on [r] ("[r] is the result of [Is_null] on [x]"),
     and no valuation that gives [x] no value satisfies that. The run
     meets neither [scrutinees_have_values] nor
     [joined_variables_have_values], two of the conditions that the
     contract of the compiler's join has
     ([sound_join_where_values_are_read]): [x] is a variable of the
     source that both uses have refined. An instance in which only the
     first fails needs the scrutinee to be a variable that the join
     makes, standing at one use for a variable with no value (the
     shape of the program that the compiler compiles wrongly); it is
     owed, with the model's join of types.

   What the instance is made with, and why it shows something of the
   compiler's function and not of its stand-ins. The join is given
   the functions of the environment of the meet, the meet, and the
   join of types. Those of the model are not under this file yet, so
   the instance has stand-ins, each of which does, on the inputs that
   this instance gives it, what the compiler's function does:
   - The join of types is given, for [x], the two types of the uses.
     The stand-in answers the first, which is their upper bound, if
     every type given is one of the two, and unknown otherwise. It is
     an upper bound ([witness_join_of_types_upper_bound_statement]),
     and what it answers mentions only [r], which the source has. (The
     compiler's function, on these two types, joins the two [is_null]
     variables, which are both [r], into [r], and the two parts that
     are not null, unknown and bottom, into unknown: the same type.)
   - The environment of the meet is the typing environment; an
     equation is added by replacing the type of a name whose type is
     unknown, and the stand-in answers [None] for any other equation.
     The compiler's function meets the two types; the meet of unknown
     with a type that is not an alias and has more than one value is
     that type, and it then replaces the type of the name
     ([Meet_env.replace_concrete_equation]).
   - The equality of types that stands for physical equality is one
     that is right of the two types of [x], which are all that it is
     asked about: they differ, so they are joined and not kept as they
     stand. (The equality of the meaning of types is not under this
     file yet.)
   The type of [x] in the uses is what a join
   brings into an environment for a variable of one of its uses whose
   type was made by reading the same field of an older block that
   another variable was read from (discrepancy T5-10 has the stages).
   That such environments, and such a run, come from a program is not
   shown: the instance is about the contract, and is the reason why
   the contract of the compiler's join has its conditions. *)
