(* Simplifying a [Switch] whose arms all apply one continuation: the
   [Switch] becomes that application, with arguments that are computed
   from the scrutinee by primitives.

   This file is to be reviewed: the definitions and the statements,
   against [rebuild_switch], [rebuild_arm],
   [recognize_mergeable_argument], [recognize_affine_argument],
   [rebuild_mergeable_argument] and the binder [let$] of
   middle_end/flambda2/simplify/simplify_switch_expr.ml. The first two
   slices are FlambdaSimplifySwitchSpec.v and
   FlambdaSimplifySwitchArmsSpec.v, whose notions and functions are
   used here; what is known of the primitives that have been computed
   is that of ../../rocq/FlambdaCseSpec.v; the machine is
   ../../rocq/FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v.

   What Simplify does. On the way up, when the arms that are left all
   apply the same continuation with no trap action
   ([rebuild_arm], [Mergeable]), it looks at each argument across the
   arms, in the order of their numbers
   ([recognize_mergeable_argument]). An argument can be merged where
   - it is the same in every arm ([Invariant_argument]);
   - it is, in every arm, the number of the arm as a naked immediate:
     the scrutinee is passed;
   - it is, in every arm, the number of the arm as a tagged immediate
     ([Tagged_scrutinee]): the scrutinee is tagged;
   - it is the tagged immediate 1 where the number is 0 and 0 where
     the number is 1, and there is no other arm ([Not_scrutinee]): the
     scrutinee is tagged and negated;
   - it is, in every arm, an immediate that is a slope times the number
     of the arm plus an offset, in the arithmetic of immediates, which
     wraps ([Affine_argument]): the scrutinee is multiplied and added
     to. The slope and the offset are read off the first two arms and
     checked against the others. This one is taken only where there are
     three arms or more ([enough_arms]).
   Where every argument can be merged, the [Switch] becomes the
   [Apply_cont] of the continuation to the merged arguments, under the
   [Let]s of the primitives that compute them ([rebuild_switch],
   [rebuild_mergeable_argument]). Before a primitive is bound, Simplify
   looks for a variable that already holds it: in what it knew before
   the [Switch] and in what it has bound for an earlier argument of the
   same [Switch] ([let$], [find_cse_simple]). So
   [switch i with 0 -> k 0t | 1 -> k 1t | 2 -> k 2t], where [0t] is the
   tagged immediate, becomes [let tagged = Tag_immediate i in k tagged],
   or [k c] where [c] is known to be the tagged [i].
   [merge_arms] here is that function. Its inputs are the arms as they
   are after the first two slices, what is known of the primitives
   that have been computed ([computed], ../../rocq/FlambdaCseSpec.v),
   and the names for the variables that it may bind.

   What is stated.
   - Of the machine ([merge_arms_refines_statement]): what
     [merge_arms] answers refines the [Switch], in every state in
     which what is known holds ([known_holds]). So does what
     [rebuild_switch] answers, which is [Invalid] for no arm, the
     merged term where there is one, and otherwise what the first
     slice makes of the arms ([rebuild_switch_refines_statement]); with
     nothing known that is a refinement of expressions
     ([rebuild_switch_nothing_known_refines_statement]). These are
     refinements and not equivalences: the [Switch] is undefined where
     the scrutinee is not the number of an arm, and the merged term is
     not.
   - Under a typing environment, after the first two slices
     ([simplify_switch_merging_refines_statement], and
     [simplify_switch_merging_of_meet_to_prove_refines_statement] at
     the transcribed meet that the contract is proved of): what
     [simplify_switch_merging] answers refines the [Switch], in the
     states whose static environment is valid. It is the function of
     the second slice with [rebuild_switch] where that has
     [switch_of_arms].
   - The functions commute with a renaming of variables
     ([merge_arms_rename_statement], [rebuild_switch_rename_statement],
     [simplify_switch_merging_rename_statement]): what is known and
     the names that are given are renamed with the term. The first
     two have no premise; the third has those of the second slice, on
     the meet and the rewrite, or on the join where the meet is the
     transcribed one that the contract is proved of
     ([simplify_switch_merging_of_meet_to_prove_rename_statement]).
   - Two terms from OCaml sources ([example_switch_index_statement],
     [example_switch_negate_statement]).

   What is assumed.
   - That what is known holds: each variable that is known to hold
     the result of a primitive is bound, in the state, to the value of
     that primitive applied to the values of its arguments
     ([known_holds]; under a typing environment,
     [known_holds_under]). It is a hypothesis about the caller, as the
     soundness of the meet is in the first slice. Nothing here says
     that what Simplify knows has it. With nothing known it holds, and
     then nothing from before the [Switch] is used: a primitive is
     bound the first time an argument asks for it, and one that is
     bound for an argument may still be found for the next ones, where
     one of its arguments is a variable.
   - Under a typing environment, what the second slice assumes, and
     its header says why.
   Nothing is assumed of the names that are given: [merge_arms] tests
   that they are distinct and occur neither in the scrutinee, nor in
   the arms, nor in what is known ([names_new]), and merges nothing
   where they are not. Nor of the numbers of the arms, which it tests
   to be immediates ([in_range]): the machine does not ask it of the
   scrutinee of a [Switch], and [Tag_immediate] has no value on a
   number that is not one. The numbers of the compiler are immediates
   by their type.

   Where the model differs from the compiler, or says less.
   - The same argument in every arm. Simplify keeps, for each argument
     of each arm, the set of its aliases in the environment of the arm,
     and looks for a [Simple] that is in all the sets, among the names
     that the term still needs ([find_all_aliases],
     [recognize_invariant_argument], [filter_and_choose_alias]). Here
     the argument is invariant where it is the same [Simple] in every
     arm, so fewer arguments are. Where Simplify finds a variable that
     is equal to the number of each arm in the environment of that arm,
     the model may find the scrutinee or bind a primitive instead.
   - Poison. For Simplify an argument that is poison in an arm agrees
     with any alias, and is skipped when a slope and an offset are
     looked for. Here a poison constant is a constant like another: it
     is the same as itself only, and it is not affine. To say more
     needs a refinement in which poison is exempt.
   - Lookup tables. Where the arguments are constants or symbols of
     one kind, the numbers of the arms are consecutive, and there are
     three arms or more, Simplify makes a static array of the
     arguments and loads from it ([Lookup_table_argument]). The model
     has no arrays, and nothing is merged there.
   - The names. Simplify makes a new variable for each primitive that
     it binds. Here the names are given, and are taken in order; where
     there are not enough, nothing is merged. An argument binds three
     primitives at most.
   - What is known. For Simplify it is its environment of common
     subexpressions before the [Switch], of which it takes an alias
     that the term still needs; here it is a list of variables with
     the primitive that each holds, as in ../../rocq/FlambdaCseSpec.v,
     which stands for what that search answers. What is bound for an
     argument is added to it for the next ones, as Simplify adds it
     to its local environment. A primitive none of whose arguments is
     a variable is neither looked for nor added
     ([Flambda_primitive.Eligible_for_cse.create]).
   - The arms. In the compiler they are a map from numbers, which is
     read in the order of the numbers; here they are a list, which is
     read in its order. The statements hold of any list. On a list
     that is in another order the slope and the offset may be read off
     other arms; on a list with two arms for one number, which a map
     has not, no slope is read off those two.
   - Arms with arguments in different numbers, which the arms of one
     continuation have not in the compiler, are not merged.

   Not here: the arms that are removed on the way up ([rebuild_arm]:
   an arm whose continuation cannot be reached, a [goto] of a
   continuation that is itself an [Apply_cont]); the arms that are the
   same [Apply_cont] ([create_switch]); the counts that Simplify keeps
   of what it has removed and added.

   The proofs are in FlambdaSimplifySwitchMergeProofs.v, which needs
   no review. *)
