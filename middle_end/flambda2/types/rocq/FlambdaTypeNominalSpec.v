(* The types of Flambda 2 as things that contain names.

   This file is to be reviewed: the two instances, against the
   interface of FlambdaNameAbstractionSpec.v, and the statements.

   [type_names] is the instance for types of the interface for things
   that contain names ([Nominal.contains_names], the model's
   [Contains_names.S]), at the sort of variables. The action of a
   permutation of the variables is [rename_type]
   (FlambdaTypeRenameSpec.v); the free names are [free_variables];
   and the equality is that of Rocq, since a type binds no name: two
   types denote the same when they are the same type.
   [env_extension_names] is the same for environment extensions. The
   names that have an equation in an extension are free names of it
   like the others: an extension is not a binder. What binds the
   names of a level is the typing environment, and that instance is
   for the file that defines one.

   A type holds no continuation, so at the sort of continuations
   types are [Nominal.no_names]; that instance is not written. The
   symbols and the code ids of a type are not names here: no renaming
   of the model moves them.

   The statements: the two instances have the laws of the interface
   ([Nominal.nominal]), and [kind], [type_well_formed] and [type_eqb]
   are equivariant functions into types with no names, in the sense
   of the interface ([Nominal.equivariant]). All are the theorems of
   FlambdaTypeRenameProofs.v, put in the form of the interface; the
   equivariance of the meaning is there
   ([type_satisfied_rename_statement]), an environment not being a
   thing that contains names yet.

   The proofs are in FlambdaTypeNominalProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
