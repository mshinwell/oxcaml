(* The environment in which Simplify rewrites the body of code that a
   [Let_static] binds, with the types of the symbols.

   This file is to be reviewed: the definitions and the statements,
   against middle_end/flambda2/types/env/typing_env.ml ([closure_env]),
   middle_end/flambda2/simplify/env/downwards_env.ml
   ([enter_set_of_closures]) and
   middle_end/flambda2/simplify/simplify_set_of_closures.ml
   ([dacc_inside_function]). It follows FlambdaSimplifyStaticsSpec.v,
   which has the types that Simplify gives the symbols of a
   [Let_static].

   Simplify rewrites the body of a function in the environment of the
   place where its set of closures is, with the variables out of
   scope: [Typing_env.closure_env] ([DE.enter_set_of_closures]). The
   symbols keep their types there. A variable bound outside stays
   known to the types and may not occur in a term: a rewrite cannot
   put it in the term, and what the types say through it, that a field
   is a constant or a symbol say, can still be used. In that
   environment the parameters are defined at their kinds with no
   types, and [my_closure] at the kind value ([dacc_inside_function]).

   The function that puts the rewrites together
   (FlambdaSimplifyPassSpec.v) rewrites the body of code where a
   [Let_static] binds the code, under an environment made from
   nothing, in which the symbols are defined and have no types: inside
   a function, a load from a symbol bound to a block is not answered.
   Here is the environment to use instead ([code_env_in]):
   [Typing_env.closure_env] of the environment of the body of the
   [Let_static] (FlambdaSimplifyStaticsSpec.add_static_bindings), then
   [my_closure] and the parameters.

   Where the model and the compiler part:
   - The compiler rewrites the body of code that is not a stub where
     a set of closures uses the code, which is in the group that binds
     the code or after it, and not where the code is bound. The
     environment there has the symbols of that group, with the types
     that FlambdaSimplifyStaticsSpec.v gives them, and may know more.
     The code of a stub it rewrites where the code is bound, unless
     stubs are to be simplified as other functions
     ([Simplify_set_of_closures.simplify_static_stub_function], called
     by [Simplify_static_const.simplify_static_consts]), in the
     environment as it is then: the symbols that the group binds to
     closures are defined, with no types; of the others, those bound
     before the code have their types, and those bound after are not
     defined. The model's code is not marked as a stub; its term has
     the code bound once and the model rewrites it once, under what is
     known just after the group. For a stub that is more than the
     compiler knows, by the types of the symbols that the group binds
     after the code to constants that are not closures.
   - The compiler defines the parameters and then [my_closure]; here
     [my_closure] is first, as the machine binds it
     (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.step, at an [Apply]) and as [code_env] of
     FlambdaSimplifyPassSpec.v has it. The compiler's code has region
     and depth variables too, which it defines after; the model's code
     has none.
   - [my_closure] gets no type here. The compiler gives it the type of
     the closure; that is for the statements about the types of
     closures.
   - [code_env_in] tests, before it defines each variable, that the
     environment passes the test of well-formedness
     (FlambdaTypingEnvInvariantSpec.typing_env_well_formed) and does
     not have the variable. The compiler has no such tests: its
     variables are fresh and its environments well formed by
     construction. Where a test fails there is no environment, and the
     code is to be left as it is. The tests are what the proofs need of
     the environment; nothing else is asked of it, so the statements
     are of every environment.

   The statements:
   - where [code_env_in] answers, the environment is
     [Typing_env.closure_env] with [my_closure] and the parameters
     defined ([code_env_in_statement]);
   - [Typing_env.closure_env] of an environment that a state satisfies
     is satisfied by the static environment of the state and no
     variables ([closure_env_env_satisfies_strictly_statement]);
   - so the environment of the code is satisfied at a call, in a
     static environment that satisfies the environment outside with
     some variables ([code_env_in_satisfied_statement]);
   - the environment of the body of a [Let_static] does not depend on
     the code that the group binds
     ([add_static_bindings_code_statement]);
   - the body of code that a [Let_static] binds may be rewritten under
     the environment of the code made from the environment of the body
     of the [Let_static] ([let_static_code_typed_statement]). Neither
     body is to bind something static: a call of code whose body does
     is undefined (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.call_function), so no rewrite
     of a body that can run is lost;
   - [code_env_in] commutes with renaming
     ([code_env_in_rename_statement]).
   - An example: in the body of code, the field of a static block that
     the group of the code binds, loaded from its symbol, is the
     constant that the field was given
     ([example_load_in_code_statement]).

   Why the types of the symbols of the group hold in the code: the
   code runs at a call, a call is after the [Let_static] has been
   executed, and what a symbol is bound to never changes
   (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v). The variables that those types name have
   the values that they had at the [Let_static]; the code cannot name
   them.

   Not here: the type of [my_closure]; the types of the symbols bound
   to closures.

   Nothing else is assumed of the term or of the environment than
   what the statements say: [code_env_in] answers, so that its tests
   have passed, and neither body of the code binds something static.

   The proofs are in FlambdaSimplifyCodeEnvProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
