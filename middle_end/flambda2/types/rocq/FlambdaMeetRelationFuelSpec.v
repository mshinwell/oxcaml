(* The fuel of the meet that a [Switch] makes where it enters an arm,
   for a scrutinee that is the result of relations: two units are
   enough, and the environment that the meet answers has again what
   is supposed of the types and of the aliases of the environment.

   This file is to be reviewed: the definitions and the statements.
   It goes on from FlambdaMeetTerminationSpec.v (what it is for the
   fuel to be enough; the meet of an alias of a name with the type of
   a constant) and from FlambdaMeetDepthSpec.v (the meet with a bare
   shape). The functions are those of FlambdaMeet.v and
   FlambdaMeetEnv.v. The proofs are in FlambdaMeetRelationFuelProofs.v,
   which needs no review.

   The meet. Where Simplify enters an arm of a [Switch] it meets the
   type of the scrutinee, an alias of a variable, with the type of the
   number of the arm, an alias of a constant. If the variable is the
   result of [Is_int], [Get_tag] or [Is_null] of a name, the type that
   the environment has for it is a head of naked immediates with an
   inverse relation to that name. The meet then does three things, one
   inside the other.
   - The variable is demoted to the constant, and the type that it
     had is met with the head of the constant
     (FlambdaMeetTerminationSpec.v, [alias_const_fuel_enough_statement]).
   - That is a meet of two heads of naked immediates. The numbers are
     met, and where they get fewer the relation says what the name it
     is a relation of can be, as a type that is added to that name
     ([reduce_inverse_relations]): [any_block] or
     [any_tagged_immediate] for [Is_int], [any_non_null_value] or
     [null] for [Is_null], and for [Get_tag] the type that the choices
     of the meet give for the tags.
   - Adding that type to the name meets it with the type that the
     environment has for the canonical element of the name.
   The last is the meet of a bare shape with a type of the environment
   (FlambdaMeetDepthSpec.v), for which one unit is enough; the second
   is one step more. A head with several relations has the second
   done for each in turn, each in the environment that the one before
   left.

   What is stated. [relation_const_fuel_enough_statement]: two units
   of fuel are enough for the meet of the two types, where
   - the canonical element that the meet reads for the first type is
     a name that is canonical, in aliases that are consistent, as in
     [alias_const_fuel_enough_statement];
   - the type that the environment has for that name is a head of
     naked immediates, with whatever inverse relations;
   - every type of kind value that the environment has for a name is
     an alias or has no extension ([values_extension_free]);
   - the types that the choices give for [Get_tag] are bare shapes of
     kind value ([get_tag_shapes]); those of the compiler's choice and
     of the repaired choice are ([choices_get_tag_shapes_statement]);
   - the join has [join_of_nothing] (FlambdaMeetDepthSpec.v); the
     join of the model has it where there is fuel for the join of
     environments ([model_join_of_nothing_statement], same file).
   The constant is any constant. Enough is [meet_fuel_enough]: the
   answer is the same whatever is answered where the fuel runs out.
   That the meet answers is not said.
   [relation_const_meet_keeps_statement]: under the same hypotheses,
   where the meet of that fuel or more answers an environment, every
   type of kind value that this environment has for a name is an
   alias or has no extension. So that hypothesis
   ([values_extension_free]) is kept by the meet for an arm.
   [relation_const_meet_keeps_aliases_statement]: and the aliases of
   that environment are consistent: the scrutinee, which was
   canonical, is made an alias of the constant, and a name that an
   equation of a relation is added to keeps its place among the
   aliases or, being canonical, is made an alias of a constant. What
   is asked of the canonical element and of the type of a scrutinee
   is not shown of the environment answered; a later meet in that
   environment still needs it.

   What the hypotheses are for. Each relation adds one equation at
   most, and after it the environment is another, of which the third
   hypothesis is shown again: the type that the name of the relation
   is given is the shape, or the type that it had, or what the meet
   of the two makes, which has no extension
   ([bare_shape_meet_extension_free_statement],
   FlambdaMeetDepthSpec.v); or the name becomes an alias of a
   constant. Types of kind value with no extension: the type that the
   environment has for the name of the relation, or for what that
   name is an alias of, is met with the shape; with an extension in
   it the meet would add the equations of the extension, for which no
   bound is known. The name of the
   relation is not asked to be canonical, nor to be another than the
   scrutinee: whatever its canonical element is, the type of that is
   an alias or has no extension, or the canonical element is a
   constant and the shape is met with its head, or the name is one
   that an equation is being added to and the equation is passed over.

   An example ([example_relation_fuel_statement]): the environment
   after [let tag = Get_tag p] of FlambdaMeetExamplesSpec.v has what
   is supposed, so two units are enough for the arm for 0, with every
   join and all choices that have what is supposed of them; and with
   the meet that is to be proved and the join that forgets, one unit
   is not enough. A second ([example_two_relations_statement]): the
   same environment where [tag] is also the result of [Is_int] of a
   third variable. Two units are enough for the arm for 1, and with
   them the meet answers: the first variable, whose type had the
   variable for its tag, is given a type that the meet makes, and the
   third the type of the tagged immediates.

   What is not here: an environment in which a type of kind value has
   an extension; and what the meet answers, beyond what is said of
   its environment. *)
