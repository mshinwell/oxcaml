(* The meet of the rows of two sets of closures; and the contract of
   the meet, from the contract of the join.

   This file is to be reviewed: the statements. The proofs are in
   FlambdaMeetClosuresProofs.v, which needs no review.

   - The meet of the rows of the closures of two sets is right
     ([meet_row_like_for_closures_ok_statement]), in the form of
     FlambdaMeetHeadsSpec.v ([type_part_meet_ok]): a row fits an
     environment, and is true of the value in hand, as the type of
     closures that it makes does. It is the proposition
     [meet_row_like_for_closures_right] of FlambdaMeetRowLikeSpec.v,
     and with the rows of blocks, proved there, it is what the meet of
     two heads of kind value was waiting for
     (FlambdaMeetHeadsSpec.v, [meet_value_heads_ok_statement]). It
     supposes what the rows of blocks suppose: the join's contract,
     the two choices of the meet that is to be proved (a variable
     that the environment knows is not defined again; the variables
     of a case that is alone are lifted), and the two contracts of
     the meet of expanded types.

   - So the meet that is to be proved has its contract
     ([meet_to_prove_sound_statement]): [transcription_sound
     meet_to_prove] of FlambdaMeetSpec.v. For every join that has
     [join_scoped_envs_sound] and every fuel, [meet_to_prove join
     fuel] has [meet_contract]. This is what FlambdaMeetSpec.v says
     is to be proved of the transcribed meet.

   - And the functions that add to a typing environment, made of that
     meet, have their contracts
     ([typing_env_functions_of_meet_to_prove_statement]):
     [Typing_env.add_equation] and [Typing_env.add_env_extension] as
     FlambdaMeetSpec.v states them, and
     [Typing_env.add_equations_on_params] for parameters that the
     environment knows (FlambdaMeetFuelSpec.v says why).

   What these do not say. The contracts say nothing of a meet that
   does not answer: the fuel may run out, and it is not shown that
   some fuel is enough. The meet is the one with the choices that are
   to be proved, which is not the compiler's on the three points of
   [meet_choices] (FlambdaMeet.v), nor on the one state at which the
   model stops and the compiler does not (FlambdaMeetEnv.v). And the
   join is any function that has [join_scoped_envs_sound]; that the
   compiler's join has it is not shown here, and it has it only for
   the runs that the conditions of the join's own statements
   describe. *)
