(* A meet adds no variable that may occur in terms.

   This file is to be reviewed: the definition and the statement. The
   proof is in FlambdaMeetTermsProofs.v, which needs no review.

   What it is for. After a meet, Simplify goes on in the environment
   that the meet answers, with the terms that it had before: so in a
   [Switch] that it prunes with the type of the scrutinee
   (FlambdaSimplifySwitchSpec.v). The machine binds the variables
   that may occur in terms under the environment given
   ([in_scope_in_terms] and [bound_in_terms], FlambdaTypingEnvSpec.v),
   and no other. So the environment answered must have no variable
   that may occur in terms and that the environment given has not.

   The definition ([meet_keeps_terms]) is of any function of the type
   of the meet, as the contracts of FlambdaMeetSpec.v are: a variable
   that may occur in terms under the environment answered may occur
   in terms under the environment given. It says nothing of the
   variables that may not occur in terms: a meet defines such
   variables, and the join that it calls makes them.

   The statement ([meet_to_prove_keeps_terms_statement]): the
   transcribed meet that the contract is proved of ([meet_to_prove],
   FlambdaMeetSpec.v) has it, at every fuel and for every join that
   has its contract ([join_scoped_envs_sound]). It follows from two
   clauses of the contracts of that file. A variable that a meet of
   expanded types has defined may not occur in terms
   ([new_names_avoided], a clause of [meet_expanded_head_keeps]);
   and a variable that the environment given knew has in the
   environment answered the name mode that it had
   ([meet_env_extends]). The first asks the same of the join: a
   variable of its result that the first environment does not know
   may not occur in terms. The join that forgets has that contract
   ([forgetful_join_sound_statement], FlambdaMeetExamplesSpec.v), so
   the statement has an instance with no premise.

   The compiler. The meet defines variables in two places, both with
   the name mode of the variables that exist only in types
   ([Name_mode.in_types]): [add_defined_vars], and the fold over the
   extra variables after the join in [meet_row_like]
   (middle_end/flambda2/types/meet_and_n_way_join.ml). The n-way
   join defines the variables of its target with the same name mode
   ([define_or_eliminate_variables_and_add_equations],
   types/env/join_env.ml). *)
