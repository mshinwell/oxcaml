(* Examples of meets: what the transcribed functions answer on a few
   environments, and what satisfies the answers.

   This file is to be reviewed with FlambdaMeetSpec.v: each statement
   is a claim that its header makes, shown on the functions of
   FlambdaMeet.v by running them. The proofs are in
   FlambdaMeetExamplesProofs.v, which needs no review.

   - The step for [Get_tag] ("The step that is not sound"). The
     environment is the one that [Typing_env.add_get_tag_relation]
     makes of two variables ([example_get_tag_env_made_statement]).
     It is strictly satisfied where the scrutinee is an immediate, and
     the number 0 has the two types that are met
     ([example_get_tag_env_satisfied_statement]). The compiler's meet
     answers an environment that no valuation that keeps the value of
     the scrutinee satisfies ([compiler_meet_get_tag_statement]); so
     it has not [meet_sound], whatever the join and whatever is asked
     of well formed types, if this input is one that a meet may be
     given ([compiler_meet_not_sound_statement]). The meet that is to
     be proved answers an environment that the same valuation
     satisfies ([meet_to_prove_get_tag_statement]). It calls the join,
     the scrutinee being now an immediate or a block; the join given
     is the one below.
   - A join that has the contract of FlambdaMeetSpec.v: the one that
     forgets the environments joined and answers the environment of
     the meet ([forgetful_join_sound_statement]). The contract asks
     for no precision, and this shows that it asks for nothing that
     cannot be had. It is not the compiler's join.
   - Adding an equation can forget ("The join that meet is given"):
     the environment answered has a valuation that the first has not
     ([add_equation_forgets_statement]). This is the compiler's
     behaviour, in both its files.
   - Poison ("What satisfies an environment"). Where a name holds
     poison and has a type that poison has not, the environment is
     satisfied with poison exempt, the value poison has an alias type
     to the name and the type of the values that are not null, and
     the meet of the two is bottom ([meet_through_poison_statement]).
     So the contract of a meet cannot be about
     [typing_env_satisfied]. *)
