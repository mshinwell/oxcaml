(* The arms of a [Switch], each rewritten under what its arm knows.

   This file is to be reviewed: the two definitions and the
   statements. Nothing runs the function yet: the function that
   rewrites a term from the types (FlambdaSimplifyPassSpec.simplify_expr)
   still calls [simplify_switch] of that file, which leaves the arms
   as they are written.

   What Simplify does (middle_end/flambda2/simplify/
   simplify_switch_expr.ml, [simplify_arm]): for each arm it makes an
   environment in which the scrutinee is the number of the arm, and
   replaces the arguments of the [Apply_cont] of the arm by their
   canonical elements there. So [switch x with 0 -> k x | 1 -> k' x]
   becomes [switch x with 0 -> k 0 | 1 -> k' 1]. Simplify makes that
   environment by a meet, and drops the arm where the meet is bottom;
   FlambdaSimplifySwitchArmsSpec.v has that function, with the meet as
   a parameter and with what the contract of the meet asks: a static
   environment that is valid and an environment in which a meet may
   be made.

   What is here is the same rewrite with the environment of an arm
   that FlambdaSimplifyPassSpec.v already makes for the handler of a
   continuation that one arm applies ([arm_env]): the variable of the
   scrutinee is made an alias of the number, with no meet. No arm is
   dropped. So the statements have no premise but that the state
   satisfies the environment, as those of [simplify_expr] have, and
   the function can take the place of [simplify_switch] in it.

   - [simplify_arm_args] rewrites the arguments of one arm under
     [arm_env]; what it answers is equivalent to the arm in every
     state that satisfies the environment of the [Switch] and in
     which the scrutinee is the number of the arm
     ([simplify_arm_args_equivalent_statement]).
   - Of the machine: the arms of a [Switch] may each be replaced by
     an arm for the same number that refines it in the states in
     which it is taken ([switch_arms_refined_under_statement]). It
     has the form of [switch_arms_refined_statement] of
     FlambdaSimplifySwitchArmsSpec.v, with the valid static
     environment taken out of both sides: an arm is asked to refine
     in every state that satisfies the environment and takes it,
     whatever its static environment, which is more than is asked
     there; and the [Switch] is then refined in every state that
     satisfies the environment, which is more than is concluded
     there. Neither statement is an instance of the other. The proof
     there does not use that the static environment is valid.
   - [simplify_switch_and_arms] is [simplify_switch] with the arms
     that stay rewritten so. What it answers refines the [Switch]
     under the environment
     ([simplify_switch_and_arms_refines_statement]). Refinement is
     what is stated, as of [simplify_switch], and what
     [simplify_expr] needs; whether the two terms are equivalent is
     not stated.
   - Both functions commute with a renaming of variables and
     continuations ([simplify_arm_args_equivariant_statement],
     [simplify_switch_and_arms_equivariant_statement]).
   - Two terms on which the function is computed
     ([example_scrutinee_under_arms_statement],
     [example_tagging_under_arms_statement]).

   What this does not do. It replaces a use of the scrutinee itself.
   A value of which the scrutinee is the untagging keeps its variable
   in the arm ([example_tagging_under_arms_statement]): the
   environment of the arm says nothing of it. Simplify keeps the
   variable there too: it knows the type of the tagged value in the
   arm, and the canonical element of that value is still the
   variable.

   The proofs are in FlambdaSimplifyArmsProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
