(* When a Flambda type is well formed.

   This file is to be reviewed: the table below against the compiler,
   [type_well_formed] and the tests defined with it against the table,
   and the statements. The grammar (FlambdaTypeGrammar.v) is that of the
   compiler's private types, and so admits types that the compiler never
   builds. The operations on types rely on the difference: meet, join,
   the provers and reification read a type as their creation functions
   make it. The compiler has no one definition of what they rely on;
   this is to be it, the part for types of the one definition of
   well-formedness (FlambdaWellFormedSpec.v has the part for terms).

   It is a test, [type_well_formed : flambda_type -> bool], with one
   test for each structure of the grammar, so that it can be run on the
   types that the compiler builds. It is meant to be true of every type
   that the compiler builds, whatever the program. A type of the
   compiler that fails it is a finding: the condition is too strict, or
   the compiler is wrong. The meaning of types
   (FlambdaTypeMeaningSpec.v) does not need it: a type that is not well
   formed has a meaning all the same.

   The conditions. "Where the compiler establishes it" is one of: a
   type that cannot express what is excluded; a creation function that
   checks, or that gives it by the way it builds; a pass that stops
   when it meets what is excluded; an invariant check, which runs only
   with [-flambda2-invariants]; or nothing. The compiler is taken as it
   runs with no option that adds checks.

   1. A set of numbers in a head, and the set of strings of a [String],
      is not empty.
      Numbers: type. The heads of naked numbers are private sets, made
      only by [create], [create_set], [create_non_empty_set], [union]
      and [inter] of [Make_head_of_kind_naked_number], none of which
      gives an empty one (type_grammar.mli: "Invariant: the
      float/integer sets ... are non-empty"); a head of naked
      immediates is abstract, and [Head_of_kind_naked_immediate] gives
      bottom or stops on an empty set.
      Strings: nothing ([Head_of_kind_value_non_null.create_string]).
      Relied on by the meet of two sets ([set_meet]), which answers
      with an input, and not with bottom, when it is included in the
      other.
   2. There is no type [Type_naked_number Kind_naked_immediate].
      Type: the compiler's [Naked_immediate] is [Type_naked_immediate]
      here, and [Type_naked_number] is for the eleven other kinds.
   3. The type [immediates] of a variant is of kind naked immediate.
      Creation function: [Type_grammar.create_variant] and
      [tag_immediate] check. [Head_of_kind_value_non_null.
      create_variant], which meet and join build with: nothing.
   4. The contents of a boxed number are of the kind boxed.
      Creation function: [Type_grammar.box_float] and the eight like
      it check. The [create_boxed_float] and the like of
      [Head_of_kind_value_non_null]: nothing.
   5. A closure type of an entry of closures is of kind value.
      Creation function: [Product.Function_slot_indexed.create]
      checks, and meet builds its products with it.
   6. The product of a case of blocks has as many types as the size of
      its index if the size is exact, and no more if it is from below.
      Creation function, by the way it builds:
      [Row_like_for_blocks.create] and [create_exactly_multiple] take
      the size from the number of types, and
      [create_blocks_with_these_tags] gives no type and at least no
      field. [Row_like_for_blocks.create_raw], which meet and join
      build with: nothing (it has a comment that asks whether to check
      an invariant). Relied on by the meet of products, which makes a
      product with a type of no value empty ([meet_mapping]), and by
      [Reify], which asserts the equality for an exact size.
   7. A shape is written in one way: a mixed record has a flat suffix
      that is not empty ([block_shape_canonical]).
      Creation function: [Scannable_block_shape.from_mixed_block_shape]
      gives [Value_only] for an empty suffix.
      [Mixed_block_shape.from_prefix_size_and_suffix_elements], which
      only the parser of fexpr calls: nothing. Relied on by the meet
      of two cases of blocks, which takes two shapes that are not equal
      to have no block in common ([meet_row_like_for_blocks]).
   8. In a case of closures:
      a. the function slots of which the entry has a function type or
         a closure type are among the closures of the index, and the
         value slots of which it has a type are among its value slots.
         Creation function, by the way it builds, for the function
         types and the value slots
         ([More_type_creators.exactly_this_closure],
         [at_least_this_closure], [static_closure_with_this_code],
         [closure_with_at_least_these_function_slots] and
         [closure_with_at_least_these_value_slots] make the index out
         of the slots of the entry). For the closure types of the
         first two: nothing, it is their caller's.
         [Row_like_for_closures.create_raw]: nothing. The n-way join
         did not keep it before f489f9445e (see
         FlambdaTypeMeaningSpec.v, on products);
      b. an exact index has the function slot of the case among its
         closures.
         Pass: [Row_like_for_closures.get_single_tag] stops on a
         single case that breaks it. Where the type is made: nothing;
      c. an exact index has a function type, which may be unknown, for
         each of its closures.
         Creation function, by the way it builds
         ([exactly_this_closure]). Elsewhere nothing. Relied on by
         the provers: [Closures_entry.find_function_type] reads a
         function type that is missing under an exact index as no
         closure at all ([Provers.prove_single_closures_entry]).
   9. A map binds a key once: the cases of a row-like structure by
      tag or by function slot, the three maps of an entry of closures,
      the equations of an environment extension.
      Type: the compiler's maps cannot do otherwise. The model's are
      lists of which the first binding wins (FlambdaMapSpec.v), so a
      second binding of a key would be dead text; with the condition,
      every binding of a map counts, and two maps with the same
      lookups have the same bindings.
   10. Every type inside a well-formed type is well formed: those of a
      variant, of a boxed number, of the cases of a row-like structure
      and of the equations of an environment extension.

   A row that says nothing, or nothing for some way of building, is an
   assumption of the compiler that it does not check. There the model
   is stricter than the compiler, which it may be where a condition
   ought to be an invariant (decision D32 of the project): the
   condition is asked of every type, however built. Those places are
   marked below at the definition that asks, and the record of
   discrepancies has them (T1-5, T1-7).

   What each condition gives is stated below for 6, 7 and 8, with the
   statements of FlambdaTypeMeaningSpec.v that have the condition as a
   premise. The creation functions of FlambdaTypeGrammar.v give
   well-formed types, each under what its caller owes it; the
   statements say what that is, as an equivalence where there is
   something to say.

   Not well-formedness, and kept out:
   - Agreement of kinds where the compiler does not check it. Two
     cases. The types of a product of blocks have the kinds of the
     fields of the shape: an invariant check only
     ([Row_like_for_blocks.check_field_tys]), and
     [Simplify_variadic_primitive.simplify_make_block] gives a block
     the types of its arguments as they are. An alias to a constant is
     at the kind of the constant: nothing checks it
     ([Type_grammar.alias_type_of]), and [Expand_head] makes the head
     of such an alias from the constant alone. Code whose kinds do not
     agree exists in real programs, in branches that do not run, so a
     type of the compiler may break either; a type that does has no
     value in the first case and none in the second. Nothing may take
     them as a premise about the compiler's types.
   - That the tag of a case of blocks fits its shape (below
     [no_scan_tag], or [double_array_tag] for a record of floats).
     [Row_like_for_blocks.create] checks it. A case that breaks it has
     no block, and nothing was found to rely on it.
   - That a set lists an element once: the numbers and the strings of
     a head, the relations of a naked immediate, the slots of an
     index. A set is read by membership only.
   - That a number is in the range of its kind.
   - What the model has not got: arrays, the [rec_info] of a function
     type, the kinds of value slots, the code age relation.
   - What a type has to do with an environment (that the names it
     mentions are bound there, at which binding time): that is for the
     typing environment to say.

   The proofs are in FlambdaTypeWellFormedProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
