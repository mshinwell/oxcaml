(* The kinds of the equations that the state of an n-way join of
   environments holds, through its first phases, and of those that
   its last phase adds.

   This file is to be reviewed: the definitions and the statements.
   The proofs are in FlambdaJoinKindsProofs.v, which needs no review.

   What is stated of adding an extension to the meet's environment
   supposes that its types are kinded in it and that each name of an
   equation is of the kind of its type ([env_extension_fits],
   [env_extension_kinded], FlambdaMeetSpec.v and
   FlambdaMeetEnvSpec.v; these are premises of statements, and not
   tests that the function makes). The equations of the
   two extensions that the join adds are made, by its last phase,
   from the equations that its state holds. This file says what the
   first phases keep of the kinds of those:

   - the aliases of the type of an equation, each with the kind at
     which it stands, are of that kind "in reach"
     ([equations_kinded_in_reach]): in the target so far, or in one
     of the joined environments. (The join adds an equation before it
     brings in the variables of its type, so "in the target" is not
     kept; where the variables are all in the target it follows,
     [scoped_equations_kinded_statement].)
   - the variable of an equation is of the kind of its type
     ([equations_of_kinds]);
   - the types kept to be joined for a variable are of its kind, and
     there is one at least ([types_to_join_of_kinds]);
   - a variable that is to be an alias of a variable that the join
     has made is of the kind of that one ([aliases_of_kinds]);
   - the definition of a variable that the join has made has a
     [Simple] ([definitions_nonempty]: with none, the join of types
     would be given no type, and its contract says nothing of the
     kind of what it then answers).
   Together: [equations_kinded]. And of the relations that the
   rounds recover: the variable that holds the result of one is a
   naked immediate ([relations_kinded]).

   The statements:
   - the first phases answer a state that has these, and relations
     that have theirs ([first_phases_kinds_statement]), under the
     premises of [first_phases_true_statement] (FlambdaJoinStateSpec.v)
     and one more: the join of types keeps [equations_kinded]
     ([join_of_types_keeps_kinds]);
   - the join of types of FlambdaJoinTypes.v, given the three
     functions of the join of environments, keeps [equations_kinded]
     ([n_way_join_keeps_kinds_statement]);
   - where every variable of an equation is in the target, "in
     reach" is "in the target" ([scoped_equations_kinded_statement]).

   What is asked of the join of types has the kinds of the state
   that it answers as a premise ([state_kinded], of the state
   answered and not of the state given): the functions of the join of
   environments keep [state_kinded] only for arguments that are
   kinded, which a statement about every call cannot suppose; but the
   kinds of an earlier state agree with the joined environments if
   those of a later state do, and the rounds have [state_kinded] of
   the state answered from the contract of the join of types.

   And the last phase: each equation of the two extensions that it
   adds is on a variable that the target has at the kind of the type
   of the equation, and the aliases of that type are of their kinds
   in the target ([last_phase_adds_kinded_statement]).

   Not here: the kinds of the names of the equations inside types. *)
