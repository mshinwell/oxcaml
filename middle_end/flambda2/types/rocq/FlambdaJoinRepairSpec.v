(* The join with the repaired test for recovering relations: what the
   repair gains, and what it does not.

   This file is to be reviewed: the definitions of the instance
   ([Brought_in]) and the statements. The proofs are in
   FlambdaJoinRepairProofs.v, which needs no review.

   The repair. In a round of the join ([n_way_join_round],
   FlambdaJoinEnv.v, after types/env/join_env.ml) the compiler
   recovers the relations that the type joined for a variable names
   ([recover_inverse_relations]) if every joined environment gave a
   type for the variable. The repaired test
   ([Join_env.repaired_choices], in the same file, beside
   [Join_env.compiler_choices]) asks one thing more before the
   relations are recovered: in every joined environment, what the
   variable stands for (the [Simple] of its definition there, if the
   join made the variable; the variable itself, otherwise) has a
   canonical element at the normal name mode that is bound there at
   that mode, that is, an alias that may occur in terms. Where the
   test answers no, the type joined is the equation of the variable
   as it is, and no relation is recorded. Nothing else of the join
   changes: the first phase, the join of types, the variables brought
   in and the last phase are the compiler's. This is the test of the
   change to join_env.ml that was proposed for discrepancy T5-10 and
   measured against the compiler (the change is not in this tree),
   written as one test where that change has two cases (a variable of
   the first environment that may occur in terms; otherwise, the
   canonical element at each joined environment). It is not shown
   here that the two tests answer alike.

   What the repair gains. The statements about the model's join have
   the value of the target on the runs that have four conditions
   (FlambdaJoinMeetSpec.v, [model_join_scoped_envs_satisfied_statement]
   for the join that the meet calls, [model_join_with_admits_use_statement]
   for the one that Simplify calls). With the repaired test one of the
   four follows from another condition, which is part of what it is
   for a machine to satisfy a typing environment:
   - [relation_scrutinees_have_values] (FlambdaJoinDefineSpec.v):
     where the variable that holds the result of a relation kept has
     a value, the variable that the relation is on has one. With the
     repaired test it holds at the run of a joined environment that
     gives a value to every variable that may occur in terms there
     ([bound_in_terms], FlambdaTypingEnvSpec.v):
     [repaired_scrutinees_have_values_statement]. That condition is
     what [env_satisfies_strictly] (same file) asks where it relates
     the variables of a machine to a typing environment: the machine
     binds the variables that may occur in terms, and the valuation
     has what the machine has for them. That definition is not a
     proof that the runs of the compiler's terms satisfy the
     environments that Simplify builds; nothing here shows that. And
     the condition is not a premise of the contract that the meet has
     for its join, nor of the contract of the join that Simplify
     calls: both are for every valuation that satisfies the
     environments.
   So the two statements, at the repaired test, have that premise in
   the place of the condition ([repaired_join_scoped_envs_satisfied_statement],
   [repaired_join_with_admits_use_statement]: the statements of
   FlambdaJoinMeetFitsSpec.v, where the premise about the types that
   the join adds is discharged, with one premise replaced).

   On the three joins of the shape of the program of discrepancy T5-10
   (FlambdaJoinMeetExamplesSpec.v, [Recovered]), by computation
   ([Three_joins], [three_joins_compiler_statement],
   [three_joins_repaired_statement]): with the repaired test the first
   two joins answer the environments that the compiler's test answers
   (the relation of the first is on a variable that may occur in
   terms, and is kept); the third records no relation on the older
   variable [t0], of which nothing is then known; and the environment
   in which [t0] is 2, which is bottom with the compiler's test, is
   not.

   What stays, and why:
   - [tags_at] (FlambdaJoinStateSpec.v): the blocks of the run have
     tags in range. It is a rule of well-formed terms (decision D23;
     FlambdaJoinSpec.v, [blocks_have_tags], says what is stated of it
     for the machine and what is owed to have it of a valuation). It
     is needed by any join that makes a [Get_tag] relation from the
     variable that a type of variants has for the tag, with either
     test.
   - [aliases_have_values] (FlambdaJoinDefineSpec.v): a variable of
     the target that takes the place of a variable that the join made
     has a value where that one has. It follows from two conditions
     ([aliases_have_values_of_values_statement], same file). One of
     them, that a variable of the first environment that has an
     equation in the level of every joined environment has a value,
     is what the contract of the join that the meet calls supposes of
     a run ([equations_valued], FlambdaMeetSpec.v):
     [equations_valued_joined_have_values_statement]. The other, that
     a variable brought in has a value at a joined environment that
     knows it, is not shown from anything, and no instance is known
     in which it fails on a run of the contract. The repair does not
     bear on it.
   - That every equation added is on a name that has a value. The
     repair does not bear on it, and it cannot go: the instance below
     is a run of the contract of the join that the meet calls on
     which the join, with either test, answers a result that has not
     the conclusion of the contract.

   The instance ([Brought_in]). The first environment knows [p], a
   value, and [g], a naked immediate, and says nothing of them. The
   first joined environment defines [x], for types only, as a value
   that may be null, of which [g] holds whether it is; and [p] is
   there a block of tag 0 whose field is [x]. In the second joined
   environment [p] is the tagged immediate 3 or 4. The join brings
   [x] into its result with the type that it has in the first joined
   environment: the type joined for [p] has a case for the block, and
   the field of that case is [x]. The run: [p] is 3 and [g] is 7. It
   satisfies the first environment and the second joined environment,
   and the one equation that the second has after the scope of the
   first is on [p], which has a value. In the result [x] has an
   equation in the level of the scope of the first environment, which
   has no equation there; so the contract asks that the valuation
   answered give [x] a value ([keeps_equations_valued],
   FlambdaMeetSpec.v), and it is to be a value of the type of [x],
   which no value is where [g] is 7; and [g] is known to the second
   joined environment, so that the valuation answered has 7 for it.
   Hence ([brought_in_no_valuation_statement]) no valuation has the
   three parts of the conclusion, and
   ([model_join_scoped_envs_not_sound_statement]) the join of the
   model has not the contract that the meet has for its join, with
   the compiler's test or the repaired one. No relation on [x] is
   involved: the test for recovering relations is not what fails.
   The part of the conclusion that fails is the one about the names
   of equations; a valuation that leaves [x] without a value
   satisfies the result (that is not stated here).

   Where the meet needs that part (from its owner): in one lemma,
   which takes a joined environment that is satisfied and whose
   equations after the scope are on names that have values to the
   satisfaction of the extension made of the level cut from it
   ([scoped_extension_satisfied], FlambdaMeetScopesProofs.v); an
   extension is satisfied only if each of its names has a value
   (FlambdaTypeMeaningSpec.v). The extension is then added to the
   environment of the meet, or put in the type answered for one
   alternative of a variant or one case of a row-like type. The
   contract asks every join and every meet to hand that on.

   A way to remove this obstruction, proposed and not proved: it is
   not shown to be enough for the contract, and it is a change of
   another size than the repair. The join would give no equation in
   its result to a variable unless every joined environment has a
   type for what the variable stands for there. That leaves out a
   variable brought in from some of the joined environments only, as
   [x] here, and a variable made whose definition has no [Simple] at
   some joined environment. The type of such a variable would be
   forgotten; or put where the variable is mentioned, as the last
   phase does already for a variable made that is mentioned once; or
   put in the environment extension of the case of the type that
   mentions it, where the meet finds it when the case is known to be
   the one (the meet does that for the variables that it defines
   after a join, its owner says). The test is the compiler's test
   for recovering relations, asked earlier: with it, a name that has
   an equation in the result would be one that has a type in every
   joined environment, and "a name that has an equation has a value"
   might be kept by every join, which is also what the compiler's
   test for relations supposes. None of this is defined here and
   nothing is proved of it. The other ways are not changes of the
   join: the contract of the meet for its join, or the meaning of an
   equation of an environment extension on a name that has no value
   (which the owner of the meet says would make the meet wrong where
   it drops a case whose extensions do not meet).

   Not here: the same question for the contract of the join that
   Simplify calls ([sound_join_of_environments], FlambdaJoinSpec.v),
   which does not ask that the names of equations have values. The
   instance does not refute it; the statements above have its
   conclusion on the runs that have the conditions, and whether it
   holds of the repaired join on every run that has tags in range and
   values for the variables that may occur in terms is open. *)
