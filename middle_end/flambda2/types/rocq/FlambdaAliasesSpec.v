(* Following aliases through a term: a normalisation that is an
   equivalence.

   This file is to be reviewed: [follow_aliases] and what it is made of,
   which are extracted and run by the validation of
   middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/, and the statement.

   [follow_aliases] goes through a term with a typing environment
   (FlambdaTypesSpec.v) holding, for the variables bound by a [Let] to a
   [Simple], that [Simple]. Every use of such a variable is replaced by
   what it is bound to ([canonical_simple]). It holds too, for the
   variables bound to a closure, the code and the value slots of the
   closure: a call of such a variable becomes a direct call of the code,
   and the projection of a value slot from it becomes what the slot
   holds. This is what the simplifier
   does with its aliases: there is no substitution, and the [Let] stays,
   to be removed if it is then unused
   (../../rocq/FlambdaNormaliseSpec.remove_unused_lets).

   Going under a binder, what is known of its name, and of anything said
   to be an alias of it, is dropped ([drop_var]): the name stands for
   something else from there on. So nothing is asked of the names of the
   term. Handlers of non-recursive continuations are gone into, with what
   is known where they are defined; those of recursive ones and code are
   left as they are.

   The result is equivalent to the term, not only a refinement of it
   ([follow_aliases_equivalent_statement]), so it may be applied on both
   sides of the comparison.

   The proofs are in FlambdaAliasesProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
