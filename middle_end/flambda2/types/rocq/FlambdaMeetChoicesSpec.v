(* The three places where the compiler's meet is not the meet that is
   proved: when each matters, and what fails where it does.

   This file is to be reviewed: three definitions, two examples and
   twelve statements. The proofs are in FlambdaMeetChoicesProofs.v, which
   needs no review.

   The main theorem (FlambdaMeetClosuresSpec.v) is for the meet with
   [repaired_choices] (FlambdaMeet.v). The compiler's meet is the one
   with [compiler_choices], which differs at three places. For each
   place this file has:
   - the condition, at the function where the choice is read, under
     which the compiler's choice does what the repaired one does, and
     what the two do where it fails;
   - an example, computed, of the meet with that one choice as the
     compiler has it and the two others repaired, on which a part of
     the contract of the meet ([meet_contract], FlambdaMeetSpec.v)
     fails.

   1. The type that the step for [Get_tag] gives the scrutinee
      (discrepancy T4-6; "The step that is not sound" in
      FlambdaMeetSpec.v). The compiler's type,
      [blocks_with_these_tags], is true of a scrutinee that the
      relation holds of exactly where the scrutinee is a block
      ([get_tag_reduction_of_block_statement]); the repaired one is
      true of every such scrutinee. So the choice matters only where
      a name on which a [Get_tag] relation is recorded may hold an
      immediate; unboxing records such relations. What fails:
      [meet_sound]. The example is that of FlambdaMeetExamplesSpec.v,
      here with this choice alone
      ([only_get_tag_not_sound_statement]). The compiler's two meets
      answer as the model does on such inputs (the differential test
      of the types library); no term that does not itself read the
      tag of an immediate was found to reach it.

   2. Whether a variable that the environment knows is defined again
      (discrepancy T4-1). The choice is read where a variable is
      defined after a join ([define_in_types], FlambdaMeet.v). The
      two choices do the same where the environment does not know
      the variable; where it does, the repaired choice does nothing
      and the compiler's defines it a second time
      ([define_in_types_choice_statement]). So the choice matters
      only where the environment that a join answered already has a
      variable that the meet then defines: where the join brought in
      a variable of an environment that it joined. What fails:
      [meet_keeps_well_formed], the environment answered knows a
      variable at two binding times and is not well formed
      ([example_rebind_statement],
      [defining_again_not_keeps_statement]). With the repaired choice
      the environment answered on the same input is well formed
      ([example_rebind_repaired_statement]). The compiler shows this
      fault with types built by hand only (a fatal error, "Cannot
      rebind", under heavy invariant checks); it was not reached from
      OCaml source.

   3. Whether the variables of a case that is alone are lifted
      (discrepancy T4-9). The choice is read in [meet_row_like],
      where one case only is kept. The lifting meet records, among
      the variables that it defines in its result, those that the
      environment of the case defines after the scope of the meet;
      the other records nothing. Recording changes nothing exactly
      where each of those variables is recorded already
      ([union_extra_variables_same_statement]); in particular where
      there is none. (To record them the lifting meet cuts the level
      of the case's environment, and stops if that fails, which is a
      fatal error of the compiler.) So the choice matters only where
      a meet inside the one case that is kept made a variable, which
      only a join does. What fails: [meet_keeps_well_formed], the
      type answered mentions a variable that the environment
      answered does not know ([example_unbound_statement],
      [not_lifting_not_keeps_statement]). With the repaired choice
      every variable of the type answered is known
      ([example_unbound_repaired_statement]). The compiler shows this
      fault with types built by hand only; it was not reached from
      OCaml source.

   Why there is not one theorem "on inputs with P, the compiler's
   meet has the contract". For the second and the third place the
   condition is about what the join makes or brings in, at each call
   inside the meet, and not about the types met; and a condition on
   the types would have to hold of every environment and type that
   the traversal reaches. The two other parts of the contract,
   [meet_kinds] and [meet_bottom_env], hold of the meet with any
   choices ([meet_of_types_kinds_statement], FlambdaMeetKeepsSpec.v).

   The examples of the second and third places are run with the join
   of the model as the compiler has it ([model_meet] with
   [Join_env.compiler_choices], FlambdaJoinMeet.v), since the
   condition is about the join. Nothing is supposed of that join: the
   statements say what is computed, and that the input is one that
   the contract speaks of.

   The state at which the model stops and the compiler does not
   (discrepancy T4-10; FlambdaMeetEnv.v) is not a choice, and no
   premise that excludes it is stated here. The contract says
   nothing of a meet that does not answer. *)
