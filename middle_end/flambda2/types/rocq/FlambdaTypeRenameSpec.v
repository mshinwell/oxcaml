(* Renaming the variables of a type, and the names that a type mentions.

   This file is to be reviewed: [rename_type] and the functions defined
   with it, against [Type_grammar.apply_renaming]; [free_names], against
   [Type_grammar.free_names]; and the statements.

   A renaming is a permutation of the variables (FlambdaNominalSpec.v;
   its permutation of continuations has nothing to act on in a type).
   [rename_type r t] renames every variable that [t] mentions: the
   simple of an alias, the variables that hold the results of [Is_int],
   [Get_tag] and [Is_null], the names of which a naked immediate is the
   result of a relation, and, in an environment extension, the names
   that have an equation as well as the types of the equations. It is
   the action that an interface for things that contain names asks
   for, as the compiler's [Contains_names] does: the statements are
   the laws of such an interface for variables, with the equality of
   Rocq, and what the functions on types owe it. The free names of
   the interface are [free_variables] (FlambdaTypeGrammar.v).

   What the compiler's function does that this one does not, the
   renamings of the model having less: a [Renaming.t] also renames
   symbols and code ids, when a unit is imported, so the compiler
   renames the symbols of a type and the code ids of its function
   types; and it drops, from the index of a case of closures and from
   the value slot types of its entry, the value slots that the
   renaming says are not used
   ([Set_of_closures_contents.apply_renaming],
   [apply_renaming_value_slot_indexed_product]). Here a symbol and a
   code id are fixed and nothing is dropped. The compiler also renames
   the variables of a [Rec_info_expr.t], in the head of a type of kind
   [Rec_info] and in the [rec_info] of a function type. The grammar
   has neither (FlambdaTypeGrammar.v), so there is nothing of them to
   rename here, nor to list in [free_names]. The compiler keeps the
   parts that do not change as they are in memory, which the model
   does not see.

   [free_names] is the names that a type mentions, the symbols with
   the variables; [free_variables] is its variables
   ([free_names_variables_statement]). The compiler's function also
   counts the code ids, the function slots and the value slots of a
   type, and records at which name mode each name occurs (in types);
   the model has neither.

   The statements, in order: the renamings act as a group on types
   (identity, composition, inverse), and two renamings that agree on
   the free variables of a type rename it alike, so that one that
   fixes them leaves it as it is; the free variables, the free names
   and the aliases of a renamed type are those of the type, renamed;
   its kind is the same, and so is the constant that
   [must_be_singleton] reads of it; a value has the renamed type under
   the renamed environment exactly when it has the type under the
   environment; the tests of types do not see a renaming; and the
   names of the equations of a renamed type are those of the type,
   renamed.

   The proofs are in FlambdaTypeRenameProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
