(* The function that rewrites primitives from the types commutes with
   renaming.

   This file is to be reviewed: the action of a renaming on what the
   function decides of a defining expression and of a [Let]
   ([rename_outcome], [rename_let_step]), and the statements.

   [simplify_expr] (FlambdaSimplifyPassSpec.v) takes a typing
   environment and a term. A renaming (FlambdaNominalSpec.renaming)
   permutes variables and continuations; it acts on terms
   ([rename_expr]), on types ([rename_type], FlambdaTypeRenameSpec.v)
   and on typing environments ([rename_typing_env],
   FlambdaEnvRenameSpec.v). The statement
   ([simplify_expr_equivariant_statement]): the function, given the
   renamed environment and the renamed term, answers the renamed
   answer. From the environment that knows nothing, which a renaming
   leaves as it is, the function is a rewrite that commutes with
   renaming in the form of the other rewrites of the validation
   ([simplify_by_types_equivariant_statement], with
   FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceSpec.rewrite_equivariant).

   The statements are equations and have no premise: nothing is asked
   of the environment or of the term. The function makes no name; the
   variables that it puts into a term are those that the environment
   answers for canonical elements and those that the provers answer,
   and both are renamed with the environment
   (FlambdaEnvRenameSpec.v, FlambdaProversRenameSpec.v). Every test
   that it makes answers the same of the renamed environment and
   term: the tests of the invariant and of the well-formed types,
   that a variable is new, that a type speaks of variables in scope,
   and those of the environment of the body of code and of the
   environment of a handler
   (FlambdaSimplifyCodeEnvSpec.code_env_in_rename_statement,
   FlambdaSimplifyHandlersSpec.handler_env_rename_statement).

   The statements for the parts of the function are here too, since
   each is a function that reads names and owes the same equation
   (those for [simplify_simple] and [simplify_simples] are in
   FlambdaSimplifyPrimitivesRenamingSpec.v):
   - [simplify_named]: the outcome is renamed ([rename_outcome]: the
     [Simple] or the type that it holds);
   - [simplify_let]: the step is renamed ([rename_let_step]: the
     defining expression and the environment that it holds);
   - [resolve_value_slot], [declare_variable], [simplify_apply_cont]
     and [simplify_switch];
   - the functions of the section "Where a continuation is applied"
     of FlambdaSimplifyPassSpec.v: [arm_env], [use_env], [leaf_uses]
     (each application is renamed with its environment:
     [rename_application]), [let_env], [find_use] (the environment
     and the binders passed are renamed: [rename_use]) and
     [binders_not_free]; and, after the function,
     [rewrite_handler_at_use]. The two tests of free names that
     [find_use] and [binders_not_free] make are the validator's, and
     that they commute with renaming is proved in the validator's
     proof file (../../rocq/FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceProofs.v),
     which the proof file of this one imports. Those lemmas are to
     move to a proof file below both before the validation runs the
     function: the validator's proof file will then import this
     one's.

   Nothing is trusted here. The proofs are in
   FlambdaSimplifyPassRenamingProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
