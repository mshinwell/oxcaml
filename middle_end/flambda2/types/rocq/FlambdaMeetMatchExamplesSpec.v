(* Examples of meets: the steps of a match.

   This file is to be reviewed: each statement says what the
   transcribed meet answers on inputs made by hand, after the calls
   of the types library that Simplify makes for the function

     type t = A | B | C of int
     let f x = match x with A -> 10 | B -> 20 | C n -> n

   The inputs are scenarios that the function suggests, written from
   a reading of Simplify. They are not the trace of a run of the
   compiler on it.

   The match asks whether [x] is an immediate. If it is, it untags
   [x] and switches on the number; if it is not, it loads the field
   of the block. The calls (in simplify/):
   - [Is_int] of [x], of a match on a variant
     ([simplify_relational_primitive], simplify_unary_primitive.ml):
     the result is defined and [Typing_env.add_is_int_relation] is
     called;
   - an arm of a [Switch] ([simplify_switch],
     simplify_switch_expr.ml): [Meet.meet] of the type of the
     scrutinee, which is an alias type, and of the type of the number
     of the arm. The arm is removed if the answer is bottom, and is
     simplified in the environment answered if it is not;
   - [Untag_immediate] of [x], and the load of a field of [x]
     ([simplify_projection], simplify_common.ml, called by
     [simplify_untag_immediate] and [simplify_immutable_block_load0]
     of simplify_unary_primitive.ml): the result is defined and the
     type of [x] is met with a shape that names the result
     ([Meet.meet_shape], which is [Meet.meet] without the type that
     it answers; the statements are about that meet). The primitive
     is invalid if the answer is bottom. A load comes to this meet
     only where a faster reading of the type of [x] has neither
     found the field nor shown the load invalid
     ([meet_block_field_simple]).

   The environments answered are long, so each is named here as what
   the meet that is to be proved answers with one join
   ([forgetful_join] of FlambdaMeetExamplesSpec.v), and the statements
   say two things of it. The first is that the meet answers it
   whatever the join, and that the compiler's meet ([compiler_meet],
   FlambdaMeetSpec.v) answers the same: no step here calls the join,
   and none is at one of the three places where the two meets differ.
   The second is what the environment says of the variables: the type
   that [Typing_env.find] answers and the canonical element.

   - [match_is_int_statement]: after [Is_int], the result has the
     relation to [x] and [x] is a variant that has the result for
     [Is_int].
   - [match_arm_immediate_statement]: in the arm for 1 of the switch
     on the result, the result is the number 1 and [x] has no blocks.
   - [match_arm_block_statement]: in the arm for 0, the result is the
     number 0 and [x] has no immediates.
   - [match_no_other_arm_statement]: an arm for 2 would be removed.
   - [match_untag_statement]: after [Untag_immediate] in the arm of
     the immediates, the immediates of [x] are the result.
   - [match_arm_constructor_statement]: in the arm for 0 of the
     switch on that result (the constructor [A]), the result is the
     number 0. The type of [x] is not changed: it names the result.
   - [match_inner_arm_statement]: in that arm, the arm for 1 of
     another switch on the result (a second match on [x], its arm for
     [B]) is removed.
   - [match_load_statement]: after the load in the arm of the blocks,
     [x] is a block of tag 0 that has at least one field, which is
     the result.
   - [match_load_of_immediate_statement]: the meet of the same load
     in the arm of the immediates answers bottom.

   The fuel is 6 throughout. The answers are those of the model: none
   was read off a run of the compiler. Examples of meets that call
   the join of the model belong with that join, which is another
   workstream's. *)
