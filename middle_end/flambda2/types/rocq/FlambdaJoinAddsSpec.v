(* What the last phase of the n-way join of environments adds to the
   target, as data: the variables that it defines and the equations
   of the two extensions that it adds.

   This file is to be reviewed: the definitions at its start, and the
   statements. The proofs are in FlambdaJoinAddsProofs.v, which needs
   no review.

   The statements of FlambdaJoinDefineSpec.v and of
   FlambdaJoinFitsSpec.v about the last phase
   ([Join_env.define_or_eliminate_variables_and_add_equations],
   FlambdaJoinEnv.v) each say "there are variables and two lists of
   equations such that the target is the environment given with the
   variables defined and the two extensions added, and ...". Two such
   statements cannot be used together: nothing says that the
   variables and the equations of the one are those of the other.
   Here they are named.

   The last phase uses the environment of the meet through functions
   that it is given, and does not look at what they answer but to
   choose, among the aliases of a variable that the join has made,
   the one that the target binds first (it reads the typing
   environment once, after it has defined the variables brought in).
   So what it defines and what it adds can be had by running it with
   functions that only write down what they are asked ([recording]):
   the variables defined, in order, and the extensions added, in
   order. [last_phase_adds] says of some variables, two lists of
   equations and a map of definitions that they are what such a run
   writes down and answers, for a given typing environment in which
   to choose aliases.

   - That relation has at most one answer
     ([last_phase_adds_functional_statement]).
   - A run of the last phase with any functions is the run that
     records, replayed ([last_phase_replayed_statement]): if it
     answers, there are variables and equations that the last phase
     adds, for the typing environment that those functions answer
     after the variables brought in are defined, and the target is
     the environment given with the variables brought in and those
     variables defined and the two extensions added.
   - The same for the join up to what it adds
     ([cut_and_n_way_join0_replayed_statement]), which also names the
     states and the relations that the first phases answer, by the
     equations that determine them.
   - The variables that the last phase defines are variables that the
     join has made, each once ([last_phase_adds_kept_statement]).
   - The equations are on variables
     ([last_phase_adds_on_variables_statement]).
   - What the equations mean ([last_phase_adds_true_statement]): the
     conclusion of [define_variables_true_statement], of these
     equations.
   - The variables of the equations
     ([last_phase_adds_in_scope_statement]): the conclusion of
     [define_variables_in_scope_statement], of these equations.

   The last two are those statements at the functions that record. *)
