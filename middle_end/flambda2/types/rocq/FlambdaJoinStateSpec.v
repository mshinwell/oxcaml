(* What the state of the n-way join means: the invariant that the
   whole join is proved from.

   To be reviewed: every definition and statement of this file. The
   proofs are in FlambdaJoinStateProofs.v.

   FlambdaJoinEnvSpec.v has a first invariant of the state of a join
   ([state_valid]), which is about its names. This file has what the
   equations that the state keeps mean, and the invariant with both
   ([state_true]).

   - One valuation of the target for each valuation of an input
     ([target_valuation]): a variable that the join has made has the
     value of its definition at that input, a variable that the input
     or the source knows has what the valuation of the input gives it,
     and every other variable has no value. It extends the valuation
     of the input, as the interface with the join of types asks of a
     witness ([target_valuation_extends_statement]). A variable that
     the join has brought in from other inputs has no value in it at
     an input that does not know it: nothing is asked of such a
     variable by the equations below, which speak of the value of a
     variable only where it has one.
   - What the state means ([state_holds]). Every equation of the
     target made so far is true at every input: the value that its
     variable has in the valuation of the target, if it has one, has
     the type there ([equation_holds]). The types kept to be joined
     for a variable are types of the environments of their indices,
     and at an input where the variable has a value there is one, and
     the value has it ([types_hold]). A variable that is to be an
     alias of a variable that the join has made has the value of that
     one, where it has a value ([alias_holds]). And each [Simple] of a
     definition is at the index of a joined environment, in its scope
     ([definitions_in_envs]).
   - The equations are asked of the runs whose blocks have tags in
     range ([tags_at], which is [blocks_have_tags] of FlambdaJoinSpec.v
     for the variables that the input or the source knows): the rounds
     need it where they recover a [Get_tag] relation.
   - The invariant ([state_true]) is [state_valid], [state_holds], and
     that the source of the state is a given one: the join of types is
     known to keep the invariant that it is given, and this is what
     tells that it keeps the source.
   - The three functions that the join of types calls meet their
     contracts of FlambdaJoinSpec.v with this invariant
     ([n_way_join_simples_true_statement] and the two after it), and
     the invariant has the witnesses that the interface asks for
     ([state_true_has_witnesses_statement]). So a join of types that
     is proved from those contracts keeps it.
   - The state that a join starts from has it
     ([created_state_true_statement]), and the first phase of the
     join, which gives each variable of the source its alias or keeps
     its types to be joined, keeps it
     ([join_aliases_true_statement]).

   - What [recover_inverse_relations] does to the type joined for a
     variable and to the relations kept
     ([recover_free_variables_statement] and the two after it): the
     type answered is true of a value of the type given, and a
     relation recorded is true of it, if the blocks of the value have
     tags in range.
   - The rounds ([delayed_equations_true_statement],
     [loop_true_statement]) keep the invariant and the truth of the
     relations kept ([relations_hold]), given a join of types that
     meets its contract of FlambdaJoinSpec.v with the invariant. With
     the first phase, that is the state and the relations that the
     join has when it comes to define the variables of the target
     ([first_phases_true_statement]).

   What is asked of the parameters of the model's functions, besides
   what FlambdaJoinEnvSpec.v asks: the equality of types that stands
   for physical equality is sound for meaning
   ([parameters_type_eqb_sound]), and the type that stands for a
   constant is that of the constant ([expand_const_sound]).

   The definition of the variables of the target
   ([define_or_eliminate_variables_and_add_equations]) is in
   FlambdaJoinDefineSpec.v. Not here yet: the contract of the whole
   join. *)

(* What is asked of the type that stands for a constant that is not an
   alias: it mentions no variable, it is kinded in every environment,
   and the constant has it. (The compiler's type for a tagged immediate
   is a type of variants whose type of immediates is an alias of a
   constant: it has an alias inside it, of a constant, which is of its
   kind whatever the environment.) *)

(* The rounds that join the types kept ([n_way_join_delayed_equations]),
   given a join of types that meets its contract with the invariant:
   from a state that has the invariant, with relations that are true
   and types to join that are true, they come to a state that has the
   invariant, with relations that are true. Whether the relations are
   recovered or not makes no difference here: a relation recovered is
   true where its variable has a value. *)
