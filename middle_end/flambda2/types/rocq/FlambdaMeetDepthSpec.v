(* The fuel of the meet of types that have no name inside: their depth
   is enough. And of the meet of a shape with a type that has no
   extension: two units are enough.

   This file is to be reviewed: the definitions and the statements.
   They go on from FlambdaMeetTerminationSpec.v, whose header says what
   the fuel is and what it is for it to be enough ([fuel_enough],
   [meet_fuel_enough]); the functions are those of FlambdaMeet.v. The
   proofs are in FlambdaMeetDepthProofs.v, which needs no review.

   What is stated. A type has no name inside, within a depth
   ([nameless_within]), if
   - it is not an alias of a name, and no type inside it is one. An
     alias of a constant is taken as the type that the constant
     expands to ([Expanded_type.create_const]): the meet of such an
     alias with a type that is not an alias is the meet of the head of
     that type with the head of the expansion, and the meet of two
     such aliases asks no meet;
   - no variable stands in it for the result of a relation: a variant
     has none for [Is_int] nor for [Get_tag], a head of values none
     for [Is_null], and a head of naked immediates has no inverse
     relation;
   - it has no extension: a variant has [No_extensions], and a case of
     a row-like structure the empty extension;
   - the types inside it (the fields of a block, the immediates of a
     variant, the contents of a boxed number, the closures and the
     value slots of a set of closures) are so within one less. The
     immediates of a variant are not counted if they have no value:
     the meet of two variants then answers that the immediates have
     none without a meet of types ([meet_unknown]).
   So within depth 1 are the types that have no type inside, the flat
   ones of FlambdaMeetTerminationSpec.v among them
   ([flat_nameless_statement]), and no type is so within depth 0. A
   type that is so within a depth is so within any greater
   ([nameless_within_more_statement]). The alias of a constant is so
   within depth 2, and within depth 1 unless the constant is a tagged
   immediate, which expands to a variant whose immediates are the
   alias of a naked immediate ([const_nameless_statement]).

   For two expanded types that have no name inside within a depth,
   that many units of fuel are enough ([nameless_fuel_enough_statement]),
   whatever the environment and the choices of the meet. Enough is as
   in FlambdaMeetTerminationSpec.v: the answer is the same whatever is
   answered where the fuel runs out. That the meet answers is not
   said: the answer that is the same may be none ([None]), as it is
   for two heads of different kinds. And the meet adds nothing: where
   it answers an environment, the typing environment of that one is
   the typing environment of the one it was given
   ([nameless_meet_adds_nothing_statement]). The same for the meet of
   two types ([nameless_types_fuel_enough_statement],
   [nameless_types_meet_adds_nothing_statement]).

   What is supposed, of the join that the meet is given
   ([join_of_nothing]): the join of environments that are each the
   environment of the meet one scope further, with nothing added,
   answers an environment that has the typing environment of the
   environment of the meet, and answers that one environment whatever
   meet the join is given. The join comes into it although the types
   have no name: the meet of two variants, and of two row-like
   structures with more cases than one, meets each alternative in a
   scope of its own and joins the environments that result, which here
   are the ones that were entered. The rest of the environment that
   the join answers (the names to avoid, which are the model's own,
   and the names that an equation is being added to) may be other than
   it was given: so the meet is said to keep the typing environment,
   and no more.

   The join that forgets has the property
   ([forgetful_join_of_nothing_statement]). The join of the model
   (FlambdaJoinMeet.v) has it where its fuel for the join of
   environments is not zero, whatever its test for recovering
   relations, its depth and its two other amounts of fuel
   ([model_join_of_nothing_statement], which is
   FlambdaJoinNothingSpec.model_join_scoped_envs_of_nothing_statement
   said with the predicate of this file). With no fuel for the join
   of environments it has it not: an example is run
   ([example_model_join_statement]) in which, with fuel, the
   environment that it answers has the typing environment that it was
   given and is not the environment that it was given, and with no
   fuel for the environment it answers nothing
   (FlambdaJoinNothingSpec.model_join_scoped_envs_no_fuel_statement
   says that of every environment that is not bottom). So what is
   stated in this file under the hypothesis holds of the meet of the
   model with such a fuel; it is said once, of the types with no name
   inside ([model_meet_nameless_statement]). Nothing is stated of the
   compiler's join.

   The bound is by the depth of the two types and not by that of the
   environment: the functions of the meet read no type of the
   environment, as no name is met. What the join reads is not
   constrained: the hypothesis is on what it answers. A depth that is
   less is not enough in general: two examples are run, one with no
   alias ([example_depth_fuel_statement]) and one with the alias of a
   constant ([example_const_fuel_statement]).

   The meet with a shape. A relation gives the name that it is a
   relation of a type that says little: [any_block],
   [any_tagged_immediate], [null], [any_non_null_value], or the blocks
   of some tags. Such a type is a shape ([shape]): it has no name
   inside, and the types inside it each say nothing or have no value;
   those five are shapes. The type that a shape is met with is one
   that the environment has for a name, and has names inside in
   general. What is asked of it is that it
   has no extension ([extension_free]): it is not an alias; a variant
   in it has [No_extensions], and a case of a row-like structure the
   empty extension; and if it is a head of naked immediates it has no
   inverse relation. It may have variables for relations, and nothing
   is asked of the types inside it, which may be aliases of names.
   For a shape and such a type, in either order, two units of fuel
   are enough ([shape_fuel_enough_statement]), and the meet adds
   nothing to the typing environment
   ([shape_meet_adds_nothing_statement]), under the same hypothesis on
   the join. Here the meet does read the environment: where a type
   inside the second is an alias, it is met with a type that says
   nothing or has no value, and the meet looks up what the alias is
   an alias of and the type that the environment has for it. It adds
   no equation, since that meet answers the type that the name has,
   or bottom. Two units are reached: an example is run
   ([example_shape_fuel_statement]), with a shape that has a type
   inside which says nothing. The shapes that the relations give have
   no type inside, but for immediates that have no value: they are
   bare shapes ([bare_shape], [relation_shapes_statement]; a bare
   shape is a shape, [bare_shape_shape_statement]). For a bare shape
   and a type that has no extension, in either order, one unit is
   enough, and the meet adds nothing to the typing environment
   ([bare_shape_fuel_enough_statement],
   [bare_shape_meet_adds_nothing_statement]): no meet of types is
   asked, so the functions of the meet read no type of the
   environment.

   The two classes are one test ([plain_type]) with two parameters:
   whether a head of values may have variables for relations, and
   what is asked of the types inside. A type with no name inside
   allows no variable and asks the same of the types inside, one
   level less ([nameless_type]); a shape allows no variable and asks
   that the types inside say nothing or have no value; a bare shape
   allows no variable and no type inside; a type with no extension
   allows variables and asks nothing of the types inside. In all of
   them the immediates of a variant may have no value.

   What is not here: names, but for the meet with a shape. An alias of
   a name, a variable for a relation on both sides, or an extension
   makes the meet read the environment and add to it, and then the
   types that are met are those that the environment has, which the
   meet itself changes. FlambdaMeetTerminationSpec.v says what a bound
   would rest on there, and what is in its way. *)
