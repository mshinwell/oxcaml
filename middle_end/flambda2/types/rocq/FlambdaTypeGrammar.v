(* The grammar of Flambda types, as the model sees it.

   This file is to be reviewed, line by line against
   middle_end/flambda2/types/grammar/type_grammar.ml (the types at its
   head, and the creation functions) and type_descr.ml, as FlambdaModel.v
   is against flambda.mli. It holds definitions only, it is an ordinary
   inductive type, and it extracts: the converter from the compiler's
   types (workstream T7) is to be a case analysis onto it, and the
   operations on types (meet, join, the provers) are functions on it.
   What a type means is FlambdaTypeMeaningSpec.v.

   What the model has of [Type_grammar.t], constructor by constructor.

   - [t]. The fifteen constructors, one for each kind, are five here.
     [Value] is [Type_value] and [Naked_immediate] is
     [Type_naked_immediate]. The eleven of the other naked numbers
     ([Naked_float32] to [Naked_mask]), whose heads are all sets of
     numbers, are the one [Type_naked_number], which carries the kind:
     [Naked_float ty] is [Type_naked_number Kind_naked_float ty].
     [Rec_info] and [Region] are [Type_rec_info] and [Type_region]. The
     prefix is there because [Value], [Naked_number], [Naked_immediate]
     and the others are the kinds and the constants of FlambdaModel.v.
     [Type_naked_number Kind_naked_immediate] corresponds to no type of
     the compiler, and the converter never gives it.
   - ['head Type_descr.t] is [type_descr head], as [Type_descr.descr]
     shows it: [Unknown], [Bottom], or [Ok] of [No_alias head] or of
     [Equals simple]. The cache of free names
     ([With_cached_free_names]) is not modelled. A [Simple] has no
     coercion (FlambdaModel.v).
   - [head_of_kind_value], with [non_null] and [is_null], and [is_null]
     itself: in full.
   - [head_of_kind_value_non_null]:
     - [Variant]: in full, with its six fields.
     - [Mutable_block]: in full.
     - [Boxed_float32], [Boxed_float], [Boxed_int32], [Boxed_int64],
       [Boxed_nativeint], [Boxed_vec128], [Boxed_vec256], [Boxed_vec512]
       and [Boxed_mask] are the one [Boxed_number], which carries the
       kind of the number boxed: [Boxed_float (ty, alloc_mode)] is
       [Boxed_number Kind_naked_float ty alloc_mode].
     - [Closures]: in full.
     - [String]: in full; a string is the list of its bytes.
     - [Array] is left out. Its [element_kind] is a
       [Flambda_kind.With_subkind.t], and the model has no subkinds; the
       machine has no arrays either. It is to be added as a constructor
       when the terms have arrays; until then the converter must refuse
       a type that has one.
   - [head_of_kind_naked_immediate] is the record that
     [Head_of_kind_naked_immediate.descr] gives, [naked_immediates] and
     [inverse_relations], and not the three constructors that represent
     it. [inverse_relations], a [Name.Set.t Relation.Map.t], is the list
     of the pairs of a relation and a name in it.
   - The heads of the other naked numbers are sets of numbers: lists of
     integers, the numbers of the floats and vectors being bit patterns
     as in FlambdaModel.v. Nothing here restricts a number to its range.
   - [head_of_kind_rec_info], a [Rec_info_expr.t], is not modelled: the
     head of a [Type_rec_info] is [unit], as that of a [Type_region] is.
     The terms of the model have no [Rec_info] (FlambdaModel.v).
   - [row_like_index_domain], [row_like_index] and [row_like_case]: in
     full, with the three fields of a case. The index of a case of blocks
     is its size, a [Block_size.t], here a [nat], with its shape; that of
     a case of closures is a [Set_of_closures_contents.t].
   - [row_like_for_blocks]: in full. [Flambda_kind.Block_shape.t] is
     [block_shape]; of a [Mixed_block_shape.t] it keeps the size of the
     prefix of values and the kinds of the flat suffix.
   - [row_like_for_closures], [closures_entry],
     [function_slot_indexed_product] and [value_slot_indexed_product]:
     in full; a product is the map it holds.
   - [function_type]: its [code_id]. Its [rec_info] is left out, as
     [Rec_info] is.
   - [array_contents] is left out with [Array].
   - [env_extension] and [variant_extensions]: in full.
   - [Alloc_mode.For_types.t]: in full, wherever the compiler has it.
     [Alloc_mode.For_types.unknown ()], which depends on whether stack
     allocation is enabled, is [Heap_or_local] in the creation functions
     here.

   Differences of presentation:
   - A record of the compiler that is defined with the types is a
     constructor with named arguments here ([Head_of_kind_value],
     [Row_like_for_blocks], [Closures_entry], ...), Rocq having no
     records in a mutual definition. The others are records, their
     fields prefixed where the name is taken.
   - [Or_unknown.t], [Or_bottom.t], [Row_like_index_domain.t] and
     [Alloc_mode.For_types.t] are in modules of those names, so that
     [Or_unknown.Unknown], [Or_bottom.Bottom] and
     [Row_like_index_domain.Known] are told from the [Unknown], [Ok] and
     [Bottom] of [Or_unknown_or_bottom.t], which are not in a module, and
     from [Or_unknown.Known]. [Relation.descr] is [Relation.t].
   - Maps and sets are those of FlambdaMapSpec.v. Those keyed by
     function slots and by value slots are its maps on names. A map
     keyed by tags ([Tag.Map.t]) is a [Keyed.finite_map Z], read with
     [Keyed.lookup Z.eqb]; a map keyed by the names of the types, each
     a variable or a symbol ([Name.Map.t]), is a
     [Keyed.finite_map name], read with [Keyed.lookup name_eqb]. A set
     of numbers is a list of them.
   - Function slots are names ([function_slot]), which FlambdaModel.v
     does not have yet: its sets of closures have one function. The
     definition here goes when it has them (workstream C3).

   The grammar does not enforce what the creation functions of the
   compiler check: that [immediates] is of kind naked immediate, the
   contents of a boxed number of the kind boxed, the closures of a
   product of kind value, the numbers of a head not empty. Nor does it
   enforce what the raw constructors of the compiler leave to their
   callers: that a product is no wider than the size of its index,
   that the slots an entry speaks of are among those of its index,
   that a shape is written in one way. A type that breaks one of these
   has a meaning all the same (often that of bottom). The header of
   FlambdaTypeMeaningSpec.v says which operations rely on which, and
   what each gives; a condition that says them all of a type is to
   come before those operations. *)
