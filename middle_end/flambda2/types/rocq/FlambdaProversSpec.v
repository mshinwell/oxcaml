(* What the answers of the provers mean.

   This file is to be reviewed: the two forms of statement
   ([prover_sound] and [meet_shortcut_sound]), what each answer is said
   to say of a value (the predicates of the section "What the answers
   say"), the domains, and the statements. The provers are
   FlambdaProvers.v, which is to be read against
   middle_end/flambda2/types/provers.ml; what a type means is
   FlambdaTypeMeaningSpec.v, and what satisfies a typing environment
   FlambdaTypingEnvSpec.v. The plan of the workstream is
   middle_end/flambda2/rocq/requests/T6-provers.md.

   The compiler has no such statements to compare with. What an answer
   means there is what Simplify does with it: these are to be read
   against the callers in simplify/simplify_unary_primitive.ml,
   simplify_binary_primitive.ml and the files that they call. A rewrite
   of Simplify that follows an answer is justified by the statement of
   the prover here, and by nothing else that the types say.

   The two forms.
   - A proof ([Provers.proof_of_property], the functions [prove_*]):
     [Proved x] says [x] of every value of the type
     ([prover_sound]).
   - A meet shortcut ([Provers.meet_shortcut], the functions [meet_*]):
     the answer stands for the meet of the type with the type of the
     values on which the operation that asks is defined, its domain.
     [Known_result x] says [x] of every value of the type that is in
     the domain, and [Invalid] says that no value of the type is in it
     ([meet_shortcut_sound]). The domain is part of the statement of
     each: it is what the caller must know of the value, from the
     operation being defined on it, to use the answer. A domain here is
     never narrower than where the primitive that asks has a value;
     that is for the statement that ties each to its primitive, which
     is to say that the primitive has a value only on the domain, and
     not the converse. There is one exception:
     [meet_project_value_slot_simple], whose domain asks more than
     that the projection has a value. Its statement is conditional on
     a premise that the machine does not give, and its [Invalid] is
     not, by that statement alone, a reason to take a projection to
     have no value (the section "Closures").
   Nothing is said of [Unknown], of [Need_meet], or of [None], which is
   a stop of the compiler (FlambdaProvers.v): a prover may answer any
   of them on any type. That a prover answers when the type decides
   the question is not stated, nor that it does not stop.

   Both forms are about a type, a typing environment and a valuation
   that satisfies the environment strictly
   ([typing_env_satisfied_strictly]): every name that has a value has
   the type that the environment has for it. The provers expand names
   (the alias that the type is, the immediates of a variant, the names
   of the relations of a naked immediate), so a statement about a
   prover needs that of every name that the prover may reach. Both
   forms also take a condition on the environment and the type asked
   about, [input], for the provers that rely on more than the meaning
   of a type gives. There are two here: none ([any_input]), and that
   the type and the types of the environment are well formed
   ([well_formed_input], with [type_well_formed] of
   FlambdaTypeWellFormedSpec.v).

   Where well-formedness is needed, and why. The provers that read the
   numbers of a type of naked immediates
   ([prove_naked_immediates_generic]: [meet_naked_immediates] and the
   three provers of tagged immediates) answer that the type has no
   value when its head is of another kind. The model's grammar has a
   type that the compiler's has not, a type of naked numbers at the
   kind of the immediates ([Type_naked_number Kind_naked_immediate]),
   whose head is of naked numbers and whose values are naked
   immediates: of it the answer would be wrong. A well-formed type is
   not that type and has none as the immediates of a variant
   (conditions 2, 3 and 10 of FlambdaTypeWellFormedSpec.v); nothing
   else of well-formedness is used by these. The condition is on the
   types of the environment too, since a prover expands names. That
   expanding the head of a well-formed type in such an environment
   gives a well-formed type is proved here, from the definitions of
   [expand_head] and [Typing_env.find].

   Three other statements take well-formed types, each for a reason
   of its own.
   - [meet_single_closures_entry] answers that a type has no closure
     where the one case of its closures is exact and has no function
     type for its own slot, which the meaning of types does not say
     (FlambdaTypeAccessSpec.v, discrepancy T1-7). A well-formed type
     has no such case (condition 8).
   - That [prove_unique_fully_constructed_immutable_heap_block]
     answers a [Simple] for every field of the block needs a product
     as wide as an exact size (condition 6).
   - [prove_physical_equality] takes two blocks of shapes that are
     not equal to be two blocks, which is so of shapes written in one
     way (condition 7).

   Poison (decision D26).
   - Under strict satisfaction a value that is poison has only types
     that say no more of it than its kind, that it is the value of a
     name, or that it is not null (FlambdaTypeMeaningSpec.v). So on a
     type that has a value that is poison the provers that the
     statements of silence list do not answer [Proved], nor the meet
     shortcuts that they list [Known_result]
     ([prover_silent_on_poison], [meet_shortcut_silent_on_poison]; the
     statements are those whose names end in
     [silent_on_poison_statement]). Only those two answers are ruled
     out. A meet shortcut may answer [Invalid] on such a type, and
     rightly, where the poison is outside its domain:
     [meet_is_int_variant_only] answers [Invalid] on the unknown type
     of naked immediates, which a poison of that kind has. And a
     prover may stop.
   - Two provers are in no such list. [meet_is_null] answers
     [Known_result false] on a type of values that are not null:
     poison is not null. The primitive [Is_null] has no value on
     poison (FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.v), so nothing follows from that
     answer where the value is poison. And
     [prove_equals_to_simple_of_kind] answers the canonical element of
     the alias that a type is, which has the value of the alias,
     poison or not: of the alias of a poison constant it answers
     [Proved] of that constant, and rightly.
   - A name that a prover reaches inside a type has its type, so what
     the prover finds of it is true of its value. In particular the
     three relations of a naked immediate are read soundly by
     [meet_naked_immediates]: [Is_int] and [Get_tag] hold of no poison,
     [Is_null] relates a poison of kind value to 0, and a name that
     holds poison has no type from which a prover answers 1. For
     [Get_tag] the prover answers only when the type of the name has
     no immediate, so it concludes nothing of a name that may be one,
     where the relation says nothing: it does not do what
     [reduce_inverse_relations] of the meet does (discrepancy T1-1).
   - The statements do not hold with [typing_env_satisfied], under
     which a name that holds poison is exempt from its type. There a
     prover that expands such a name answers what the environment says
     of the name, which is not true of its value. One case is known:
     a name that holds poison and that the environment gives the type
     of null, and a naked immediate with the relation [Is_null] to
     that name: the number is 0 by the relation, and
     [meet_naked_immediates] answers that it is 1 (discrepancy T6-1;
     T1-9 is the same). Where no name holds poison the two notions
     are one (FlambdaTypingEnvSpec.v), and a statement here holds
     with [typing_env_satisfied]: the last section says so of the two
     forms. A finer statement, whose premise is only of the names
     that a prover reaches, is not made.

   A [Simple] that a prover answers. Where an answer is a [Simple],
   the statement is that the [Simple] has a value in the valuation
   ([eval_simple valuation s]). That is not yet that a term may use
   it in place of what was asked about. A valuation gives values to
   names that no term can mention (those of name mode [In_types],
   those out of scope), and the environment of the machine agrees
   with it only on the names in scope at the normal name mode
   ([agrees_in_terms] of FlambdaTypingEnvSpec.v). A rewrite that puts
   the [Simple] in a term needs that it is such a name, a symbol or a
   constant, which is for its own statement to get from the name mode
   that it asked the prover for, with the premises on the environment
   that FlambdaTypingEnvSpec.v has for that; nothing here says it.

   What rests on another workstream, until its files are under this
   branch (FlambdaProversStandIn.v). Every statement here has the
   premise [expand_head_sound_assumed]: expanding the head of a type
   keeps its values. It is, word for word, the statement that the
   workstream on meet (T4) proves of [expand_head] on its branch
   [flambda2-rocq/T4-meet], and it goes when the proof is here. Where
   a prover reads a row-like structure it is through the functions of
   FlambdaTypeAccessSpec.v, with the statements there.

   What is not said.
   - Code age, allocation modes and uniqueness: nothing in these
     statements is about them (FlambdaTypeMeaningSpec.v).
   - A tagged immediate is any constant [Tagged_immediate], whatever
     its number, as in the meaning of types; the primitives have a
     value only on one in the range of the machine.
   - A set that a prover answers is a list, and the statements read it
     by membership.

   The primitives. The last section ties the scrutinee questions to
   the primitives of the machine: each of [Is_int], [Is_null],
   [Get_tag] and [Untag_immediate] has a value only on a value of the
   domain used here, and its value is what the answer says
   ([is_int_defined_statement] and the three beside it); and the two
   things that Simplify does with [prove_is_int] are right
   ([prove_is_int_is_int_statement], [prove_is_int_get_tag_statement]).
   The other primitives that ask a prover of this file (arithmetic and
   comparison on tagged and naked immediates, [Boolean_not], the
   conversions) are for the workstream of those rewrites to tie to
   the domains in the same way.

   The proofs are in FlambdaProversProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
