(* The environment side of the n-way join of typing environments.

   This file is to be reviewed line by line against
   middle_end/flambda2/types/env/join_env.ml, as FlambdaTypingEnv.v is
   against typing_env.ml, and its last function against the n-way
   entry of types/join_levels.ml. It holds definitions only, in modules
   that have the compiler's names. What the join guarantees is
   FlambdaJoinSpec.v. [Type_grammar.project_variables_out], which the
   join calls, is FlambdaTypeProject.v.

   What is here, against join_env.ml, in the order of that file:
   - [Index]: the environments joined are numbered from 0 in the order
     of the list given ([Index.fold_list]). An index is a position, not
     a name: renaming leaves it alone. [Index.choose] is
     [Index.Map.choose], as the binding of the least index.
   - [Simples_in_joined_envs.t]: a [Simple] for each of some of the
     indices, as a map read with [Index.equal]. In the compiler it is
     also the key of a map ([Simples_in_joined_envs.Map]); two vectors
     are the same key when they bind the same indices to the same
     [Simple]s ([Simples_in_joined_envs.equal]).
     [choose_a_suitable_name] is left out: the names of the model are
     numbers.
   - [Source_env]: [exists_in_source_env], [exists_at_name_mode] and
     [candidate_canonical_in_source_env]. The compiler's type of that
     name is [candidate] here.
   - [Bindings_in_target_env]: the record, [from_source_env],
     [exists_in_target_env], [has_existential_for_these_simples],
     [existential_for_these_simples], [import_from_all_envs] and the
     two folds, as lists.
   - [Joined_envs]: [get_nth_joined_env], [exists_in_all_joined_envs],
     [equal_in_all_joined_envs],
     [get_alias_then_canonical_simple_ignoring_name_mode_exn],
     [find_simples_in_joined_envs], [find_imported_var],
     [get_canonical_simples_ignoring_name_mode].
   - [Aliases_of_existentials].
   - [Join_env]: the state [t] and [create];
     [new_definitions_of_existentials], [new_equations_in_joined_envs];
     [existential_for_these_canonicals], [add_alias_of_existential],
     [add_equation_in_target_env], [add_equations_in_joined_envs];
     [n_way_join_canonical_simples]; the five functions that import
     ([import_or_delay_n_way_join_type],
     [import_or_delay_n_way_join_of_concrete_type],
     [add_equals_in_joined_envs], [import_type_transitive],
     [import_var_transitive]) and [import_name_transitive];
     [join_aliases_into_bindings];
     [add_inverse_relation_to_env_extension] and
     [recover_inverse_relations]; [n_way_join_round], and the two loops
     of [cut_and_n_way_join0] ([n_way_join_delayed_equations],
     [n_way_join_loop]); what the join of types calls: [joined_env],
     [import_type], [n_way_join_simples], [n_way_join_env_extension];
     [move_definition], [move_equation], [move_inverse_relation] and
     [define_or_eliminate_variables_and_add_equations]; [cut_for_join],
     [cut_and_n_way_join0] and [cut_and_n_way_join], which is the join
     that the meet calls.
   - [Analysis.t]: the three fields of the compiler's record;
     [Analysis.simple_refined_at_join], with
     [Variable_refined_at_join.fold_values_at_uses] as the list
     [values_at_uses], and [fold_variables_created_at_join] with
     [Simples_at_join.fold_definitions_at_uses] as the list
     [variables_created_at_join]: what Simplify reads
     (simplify/join_points.ml, simplify_switch_expr.ml,
     specialization_cost.ml); and [Analysis.create].
   - [cut_and_n_way_join_with_analysis], after the analysis here, and
     [Join_levels.cut_and_n_way_join] for the n-way algorithm.

   The differences:
   - A [Simple] of the model has no coercion (the terms have no
     [Rec_info]), so the wrappers that keep a coercion beside a name
     are plain [simple]s, and [Import_from_all_joined_envs] and
     [Latest_bound_source_var] carry a variable only.
   - The wrappers that tell the environment a name belongs to
     ([Variable_in_target_env], [Simple_in_one_joined_env], ...) are
     the plain types: they are a discipline of the compiler's types and
     hold no data.
   - New names. A variable that the compiler makes ([Variable.create])
     differs from every other. Here [existential_for_these_simples]
     is given a function [fresh] and the bindings carry the names to
     avoid; the variable made is [fresh] of those names and is added to
     them. Which variable is made is not specified
     (FlambdaJoinSpec.v). The join that Simplify calls is given the
     names to avoid; the one that the meet calls takes them from the
     environment of the meet and adds the variables that the
     environments it is given know. Either way the last phase, which
     adds equations to the target through the meet, is given the
     environment of the meet with the names of the join for names to
     avoid: those that it was given and the variables that it made.
     So a join that one of those meets calls makes no variable that
     the outer join made or that an environment joined knows; and the
     target answered has for names to avoid those of the join and
     those that the meets added, so that the joins of two branches of
     a meet do not make one variable twice.
   - The environment of the meet. Its functions are given to the join
     in a record ([meet_env_functions]), with the meet of expanded
     types that they take; the model's are in the files of the meet.
   - The variable that stands for an existential variable that has
     aliases among the variables of the target. The compiler takes the
     least of them in the order of variables; the model, the one that
     the target binds first ([choose_alias]). The others become its
     aliases in either case, so the environments differ in which
     variable holds the type, the definition of the analysis and the
     inverse relations before the equations are added.
   - Kinds of variables. A variable of the compiler carries its kind
     ([Variable.kind]), and [import_var_transitive] reads it. A
     variable of the model is a number. The kind of a variable that is
     imported is that of the type that the first joined environment
     that knows it has for it ([Joined_envs.kind_of_imported_var]); the
     other environments are then asked for its type at that kind, as
     in the compiler, and [None] is answered if one has it at another.
   - Physical equality of types is not in the model. In
     [import_or_delay_n_way_join_of_concrete_type] and
     [n_way_join_env_extension] the compiler tests it; the functions
     here are given an equality of types and of environment extensions
     ([parameters]) and test that, which is what the compiler does
     under -flambda2-join-sharing structural.
   - Recursion. The five functions that import are one recursion in
     the compiler, which ends because a variable is imported once.
     Here each takes the function that imports a variable, and
     [import_var_transitive] is defined last by recursion on fuel. The
     loop of [n_way_join_delayed_equations] takes fuel too, and so
     does [expand_variable], the function that gives the type to put
     for a variable that is removed (in the compiler it ends because
     such a variable is mentioned once). The loop of
     [add_inverse_relation_to_env_extension] follows aliases until it
     has seen a name twice; here it has also a bound on the number of
     steps.
   - The names that every level has an equation for. The compiler
     finds them with iterators over the maps of the levels
     ([fold_incremental_join], in the order of names); here they are
     those of the first level that the others have too
     ([names_with_equations_everywhere]). The compiler's inputs are
     incremental (the fields [previous], [diff] and [current] of a
     level's equations), for a join of environment extensions that it
     does not do: where they are made ([cut_for_join]), [previous] is
     empty and [diff] is [current], and then the fold visits the names
     that every level has an equation for, or none if a level has no
     equation. The model has the equations only.
   - [Map.diff_shared] in [new_definitions_of_existentials] and
     [new_equations_in_joined_envs] is "the bindings whose key the
     older map has not": each key is added once.
   - Order. A fold is the list of what it visits, in the order of the
     map that the model has (the order in which the bindings were
     added, or its reverse where the header of a function says so),
     which is not the compiler's (the order of the keys). It visits the
     bindings that count ([compact]): a map of the model is a list of
     which the first binding of a key counts. (One exception: the fold
     over the equations of an environment extension in
     [n_way_join_env_extension] visits every equation; see there.) The
     canonical element
     that is chosen for a vector does not depend on the order
     ([candidate_canonical_in_source_env] answers the same for every
     order of the indices); which variable is imported first, and so
     which names are made, does.
   - Two variables of the source with one binding time are ordered by
     the compiler by their names ([Typing_env.stable_compare_simples]);
     [Source_env.latest_bound] answers [None] for them. A well-formed
     environment has no two such variables.
   - A fatal error of the compiler, and a failed [assert], is [None]:
     an index with no environment or no external identifier, a
     variable with two equations in the target, a join of no type, a
     name that has not a type of naked immediates where an inverse
     relation is to be added. The checks that the compiler makes only
     with [Flambda_features.check_light_invariants] are not made.
   - The test for recovering relations. In [n_way_join_round] the
     compiler recovers the relations that the type joined for a
     variable names if every joined environment gave a type
     ([Joined_envs.exists_in_all_joined_envs]). Here the test is an
     argument of the rounds and of the joins made with them
     ([choices]). [compiler_choices] is the compiler's test, and with
     it the functions are the compiler's. [repaired_choices] is not in
     the compiler: it asks also that the variable stands, in every
     joined environment, for something that has a value there
     (discrepancy T5-10).
   - [machine_width], [Analysis.print] and the symbol projections
     ([n_way_join_symbol_projections], and the second component of
     [cut_for_join]) are left out: the model's environment has no
     symbol projections (FlambdaTypingEnv.v). The handler that prints
     the levels when the join stops with a fatal error is left out. *)
