(* The meet and its fuel.

   This file is to be reviewed: the definitions and the statements,
   which are about the functions of FlambdaMeet.v and FlambdaMeetEnv.v.
   The contract of the meet is FlambdaMeetSpec.v. The proofs are in
   FlambdaMeetTerminationProofs.v, which needs no review.

   The meet of expanded types is defined by recursion on a number, the
   fuel ([Meet.meet_expanded_head], FlambdaMeet.v): with no fuel it
   answers nothing, and with one more it is [meet_expanded_head_step]
   of the meet with one less. The compiler has no fuel: its meet is a
   recursive function, and nothing in it says why it ends. So a [None]
   of the model is a fatal error of the compiler, or the one state at
   which the model stops and the compiler does not (FlambdaMeetEnv.v,
   "A name that is no longer canonical"), or fuel that has run out; and
   the contract of the meet, which is about the answers that are not
   [None], says nothing of an input on which no fuel is enough.

   What is stated here is what can be said of the fuel without a
   bound on it. First, an answer, once given, is the answer at every
   greater fuel.
   - [meet_head_le mh mh']: wherever the meet of expanded types [mh]
     answers, [mh'] gives the same answer.
   - One step is monotone ([meet_expanded_head_step_monotone_statement]):
     the step of a meet that answers more answers more. The join that
     the meet is given takes the meet of less fuel too, so it is asked
     to be monotone in it ([join_monotone]); the join that forgets
     (FlambdaMeetExamplesSpec.v) is
     ([forgetful_join_monotone_statement]). That the compiler's join is
     monotone in its meet is not stated here.
   - So the meet of expanded types answers at a greater fuel what it
     answers at a lesser ([meet_expanded_head_fuel_monotone_statement]),
     and so do the meet of types ([meet_fuel_monotone_statement]),
     [Meet.meet_shape] ([meet_shape_fuel_monotone_statement]) and the
     functions that add to a typing environment
     ([typing_env_functions_fuel_monotone_statement]).
   - So an input has one answer at most, whatever the fuel
     ([meet_answer_unique_statement]).
   Nothing is supposed of the inputs, of the choices of the meet
   ([meet_choices]) or of the contract of the join.

   Second, what it is for the fuel to be enough, [None] included. A
   [None] of the model does not say whether the fuel ran out, so that
   cannot be said of the answers alone. The meet of no fuel answers
   [None] on every input; [meet_expanded_head_over] is the meet with
   any meet [mh0] in its place. The fuel is enough on an input
   ([fuel_enough], [meet_fuel_enough]) if the answer is the same
   whatever [mh0] is. That is a property of the answers and not of how
   the meet runs: it does not say that the meet never gets to the
   bottom of its fuel on that input (the join, which is any function
   here, may ask the meet that it is given and not use the answer),
   only that what is answered there makes no difference.
   - Where the fuel is enough, more fuel is enough and the answer is
     the same, [None] included ([fuel_enough_stable_statement],
     [meet_fuel_enough_stable_statement]). So a [None] at a fuel that
     is enough is a [None] at every greater fuel: more of this fuel
     does not remedy it. What it is otherwise is not said here: a
     fatal error of the compiler, the one state at which the model
     stops, or a [None] of the join, which where it is the transcribed
     join has fuel of its own. This supposes nothing of the join.
   - A fuel at which the meet answers is enough
     ([answer_fuel_enough_statement], [meet_answer_fuel_enough_statement]),
     for a join that is monotone.

   Third, the inputs for which a fuel is known, which are few. An
   expanded type is flat ([flat]) if it says nothing, or has no value,
   or is a set of numbers, with no relation if they are naked
   immediates. A flat type has no type and no name inside. Not every
   type of which that is so is flat: no head of values is, not even
   that of null or of a string.
   - The meet of two flat expanded types asks for no other meet, so
     one unit of fuel is enough ([flat_fuel_enough_statement]); and so
     is it where one of the two says nothing or has no value, whatever
     the other is ([unknown_or_bottom_fuel_enough_statement]).
   - For two types that are not aliases, the meet of types reads
     nothing of the environment before it asks the meet of their
     heads, in the environment as it was given: a fuel that is enough
     for that meet is enough for the meet of the types
     ([non_alias_fuel_enough_statement]). (The meet of the heads is
     given the environment and may read it: a head that is not an
     alias may have aliases inside.) So one unit is enough for two
     flat types that are not aliases
     ([flat_types_fuel_enough_statement]).
   - A type that is not an alias, met with the type of a constant,
     which is an alias of the constant: the one meet that is asked for
     is that of the head of the type with the head of the constant
     ([const_fuel_enough_statement]).
   - An alias of a name, met with the type of a constant, where the
     name is canonical: the name is demoted, and the one meet that is
     asked for is that of the type that the environment had for the
     name with the head of the constant
     ([alias_const_fuel_enough_statement]). So one unit is enough
     where that type is flat and the constant is a naked number
     ([alias_flat_const_fuel_enough_statement]). That is the meet
     that Simplify makes for an arm of a [Switch] on a variable whose
     type is a set of numbers, as the result of a comparison is; an
     example is run ([example_alias_const_fuel_statement]).
   These hold of every join and of every choice of the meet. They are
   the bottom of a bound by the depth of the types and no more than
   that. They say nothing of a type of values with a block or a
   closure in it, of two aliases of names, of an alias met with a type
   that is not that of a constant, or of a naked immediate that is the
   result of a relation: the types that Simplify meets at a [Switch]
   on the tag of a variant are of those.

   What is not here: a bound for the other inputs. That is, a number
   computed from the environment and the two types at which the fuel
   is enough, [meet_fuel_enough join choices (bound tenv t1 t2) tenv
   t1 t2], for the inputs that a meet may be given. With it and
   [meet_fuel_enough_stable_statement] the answer of the meet does not
   change from the bound on. No argument for it is written down in the
   compiler, and nothing here proves any part of what follows.

   What a proof would rest on. A meet of expanded types of less fuel
   is asked for in three ways: for two parts of the types in hand,
   which are smaller; for a type and the type that the environment has
   for a canonical name, where an equation is added to the name; and,
   where two canonical elements are made equal, for the type that the
   name demoted had and the type of the other, or the constant that
   the other is. In the second the name is among those that an
   equation is being added to until that meet answers
   ([Meet_env.adding_equation_for_name]), and an equation on such a
   name is passed over; in the third a name ceases to be canonical. So
   along the meets that are inside one another those of the second and
   third ways are no more than twice the names of the environment, and
   between two of them the types get smaller.

   What is in the way of a bound. The types of the environment change
   while the meet runs: a meet gives a name the type that it answers,
   and that type holds the extensions made from the equations added in
   the scopes of a disjunction, so it can be deeper than the two types
   met. And a join may define variables, which are new names; the join
   that forgets defines none.

   What comes next, in the order of what it costs. For types with no
   name inside and a join that does not ask the meet it is given, a
   bound by the depth of the two types: it needs, of each function of
   FlambdaMeet.v that is given a meet, that it asks that meet only of
   parts of what it is given. That is the form of the lemmas by which
   more fuel changes no answer, with a measure carried through; the
   folds over the fields of a product and over the cases of a row-like
   structure are where the work is. For types with names, the same
   with the invariant on the environment that the paragraph above asks
   for. For a join that defines variables, nothing is known. *)
