(* The function that rewrites a term from the types, with the arms of a
   [Switch] removed that the type of the scrutinee excludes: a second
   function, whose theorem is about the states of the run of a unit
   whose sets of closures are well formed.

   This file is to be reviewed: every definition and every statement.
   The function is meant to be extracted and run by the validation of
   middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/; nothing runs it yet.

   Why a second function. [simplify_by_types]
   (FlambdaSimplifyPassSpec.v) refines the term in every state, and
   removes no arm of a [Switch] by a meet: where the scrutinee has a
   constant for canonical element it takes the arm of the constant,
   and that is all. The law by which Simplify removes the
   arms that the type of the scrutinee excludes
   (FlambdaSimplifySwitchSpec.v) rests on the meet, whose contract
   supposes that the static environment is valid
   (../../rocq/FlambdaClosuresSpec.statics_valid): it holds in the
   states that have a valid static environment and not in every state.
   A step keeps no such thing by itself: a [Let_static] of a term that
   is not well formed can bind what is not valid. What a step keeps is
   [run_valid]: every value that the state holds is valid
   ([state_valid], ../../rocq/FlambdaClosuresSpec.v), and the sets of
   closures of every term that it holds are well formed (its
   expression, the handlers that its continuations keep, the code that
   is bound: [sets_inv], the same file). The state that a unit starts
   in has it as soon as the sets of the unit are well formed
   (../../rocq/FlambdaWellFormedSpec.sets_well_formed, a test, and one
   of the conditions of a well-formed unit).

   What is stated.
   - Of [run_valid]: a step keeps it ([run_valid_kept_statement]); the
     state that a unit with well-formed sets starts in has it
     ([run_valid_initial_statement]); its static environment is valid
     ([run_valid_statics_statement]); and it reads the expression of
     the state through the test of its sets only
     ([run_valid_expr_statement]).
   - Refinement under a typing environment from the states that have
     [run_valid] ([expr_refines_from_valid]): it follows from
     refinement in every state that satisfies the environment, and
     from refinement in those whose static environment is valid
     ([from_valid_weaken_statement]); two steps make one where the
     term between has well-formed sets
     ([expr_refines_from_valid_trans_statement]); from the environment
     that knows nothing it is refinement of the two terms run on their
     own, if the sets of the first are well formed
     ([from_valid_program_statement]).
   - The function: [simplify_expr_pruning prune tenv fit e] is
     [simplify_expr tenv e] (FlambdaSimplifyPassSpec.v), with one more
     argument, [prune], a function that may rewrite a [Switch] from
     the environment, and a boolean, [fit], that says whether meets
     may be made in the environment (below). What [prune] is asked is
     [switch_rewrite_sound]; the function of
     FlambdaSimplifySwitchSpec.v that removes arms has it, for a meet
     that has [meet_bottom_sound]
     ([simplify_switch_rewrite_sound_statement]). What the function
     answers has well-formed sets if the term has
     ([simplify_expr_pruning_sets_statement]) and refines the term
     from the states that have [run_valid]
     ([simplify_expr_pruning_refines_statement]); from the environment
     that knows nothing, a unit with well-formed sets refines what the
     function makes of it
     ([simplify_by_types_pruning_refines_statement]). With a [prune]
     that answers nothing it is the first function
     ([simplify_expr_no_pruning_statement]).
   - With the transcribed meet that the contract is proved of
     ([meet_to_prove], FlambdaMeetSpec.v):
     [simplify_by_types_pruning_with join fuel] refines a unit with
     well-formed sets for a join that has the contract of a join,
     whatever the fuel
     ([simplify_by_types_pruning_with_refines_statement]); and
     [prune_by_types fuel], which is that function at the join that
     forgets, applied where the sets of the unit pass their test and
     the identity elsewhere, has no premise at all
     ([prune_by_types_refines_statement]). That one is for the
     validation to run.
   - Two terms on which it is computed, with the transcribed meet, and
     what the first function answers on them
     ([example_pruning_no_arm_statement],
     [example_pruning_comparison_statement]).

   Where a meet may be made. The law of the pruning asks
   [typing_env_fits] of the environment (FlambdaMeetSpec.v). Two of
   its conditions have no test: [levels_agree] (in
   [typing_env_invariant]) and [aliases_kinded]. The function carries
   a boolean for them, [fit]: it is true where the two are known of
   the environment ([known_to_fit]). It is true of the environment
   that knows nothing; the environment of the body of code has the
   two conditions if the environment after the group that binds the
   code has them ([code_env_in_known_to_fit_statement]), so the
   boolean in the code is the one after the group; and at a [Let], and
   at a
   [Let_static] for the types that its symbols are given, it stays
   true if the premises of the statements by which the function that
   extends the environment keeps the two conditions pass as tests
   ([let_keeps_fit], [let_keeps_fit_sound_statement];
   [statics_keep_fit], [statics_keep_fit_sound_statement]). At a
   [Switch] the rest of
   [typing_env_fits] is tested ([types_fit_b],
   [types_fit_b_fits_statement]), and that the scrutinee may occur in
   terms. Where [fit] is false or a test fails nothing is pruned: a
   failure costs rewrites and not correctness. None of these tests is
   Simplify's (the CR at [known_to_fit]).

   What is assumed. The theorem from the environment that knows
   nothing ([simplify_by_types_pruning_refines_statement]) has two
   premises: [switch_rewrite_sound prune], which for the pruning of
   FlambdaSimplifySwitchSpec.v is [meet_bottom_sound meet] (that file
   says what is and is not known of it for the transcribed meet); and
   that the sets of the term are well formed, which is a test. The two
   statements about any environment
   ([simplify_expr_pruning_sets_statement],
   [simplify_expr_pruning_refines_statement]) ask [known_to_fit tenv
   fit] as well: whoever calls the function with [fit] true owes the
   two conditions of the environment.

   Not here. The arms that are kept are not rewritten with what the
   meet finds of them, and the environment that the meet answers for
   an arm is not kept. The function does nothing in the handler of a
   continuation, as the first does not. That it commutes with
   renaming is in FlambdaSimplifyPruningRenamingSpec.v. That it keeps
   scope (../../rocq/FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceSpec.v) is not
   stated: the validation can have it by the test of
   ../../rocq/FlambdaGuardScopeSpec.v.

   The proofs are in FlambdaSimplifyPruningProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
