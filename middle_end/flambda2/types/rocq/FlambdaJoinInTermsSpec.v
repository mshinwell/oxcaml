(* The join that Simplify calls, on the runs that give a value to
   every variable that a use knows.

   This file is to be reviewed: the definitions and the statements.
   The proofs are in FlambdaJoinInTermsProofs.v, which needs no review.

   What it is for. The contract of the join that Simplify calls
   ([sound_join_of_environments], FlambdaJoinSpec.v) is for every
   valuation that satisfies a use and the source. Two instances of
   the transcribed join, each with stand-ins for the join of types
   and for the environment of the meet, have not that contract
   (FlambdaJoinEnvSpec.v, [Witness], with the compiler's test for
   recovering relations; FlambdaJoinRepairSpec.v, [In_terms], with
   the repaired one). What is merged of its sixth part
   ([join_admits_use]) is for the runs that have four conditions
   (FlambdaJoinMeetFitsSpec.v,
   [model_join_with_admits_use_outright_statement]). Those are
   stated on the state of the join, and not on what a caller has:
   its inputs, the answer and the run. A caller that rewrites the
   handler of a continuation under the join of the environments of
   its applications (that statement is not in this tree) has inputs
   of one shape and runs of one sort. This file states the join for
   them, with premises that are about the inputs, the answer and the
   run only.

   The join. It is the transcribed join with a meet of expanded types
   that is given ([model_join_with], FlambdaJoinMeetSpec.v), which is
   supposed to have the two contracts of a meet, and with any test
   for recovering relations ([Join_env.choices]: the compiler's,
   [Join_env.compiler_choices], and the repaired one,
   [Join_env.repaired_choices], are two). It is not [model_join]: the
   meet of the model is not shown to have the second contract. A meet
   that has both is known
   ([meet_with_forgetful_join_has_contracts_statement], same file).
   The meet is used where the join adds an equation on a name.

   The statements.
   - The five parts of [join_guarantees] that are not about
     valuations, for that join, under premises about the inputs
     only ([model_join_with_guarantees_on_inputs_statement]).
     They are merged for [model_join], at the meet of the model
     ([model_join_guarantees_on_inputs_statement],
     FlambdaJoinMeetFitsSpec.v); this is the same statement with the
     meet given, supposed to have the first contract. The first part
     ([typing_env_fits], FlambdaMeetSpec.v) says that the target has
     the invariant of typing environments, is kinded and has no
     bottom type.
   - The sixth part ([model_join_with_admits_use_valued_statement]),
     for inputs of the shape below, at a use that is not bottom where
     the answer passes a test, and for the runs that have three
     conditions ([run_with_values]): a valuation that satisfies the
     use and the source extends to one that satisfies the target, as
     [join_admits_use] says; and that valuation gives a value to
     every variable that the source knows and to every variable that
     the analysis has a definition for. So a caller whose valuations
     give a value to every known variable has one again for the
     target, where the target knows no other variable (the meets
     that add the equations may define variables; nothing is said of
     what the valuation gives them).
   - The same as [join_admits_use_on] (FlambdaJoinSpec.v), without
     the last part ([model_join_with_admits_use_on_statement]).
   - The same in the machine ([model_join_with_in_machine_statement]):
     if the variables of terms of the source are variables of terms
     at each use, a state of the machine that satisfies the use and
     the source through a valuation that has the conditions satisfies
     the target, through a valuation that has the last part.
   - The test on the answer as a function, and that it gives the
     premise ([kept_defined_at_uses_b_sound_statement]).
   - Where the condition on values comes from, for a use that knows
     only variables that may occur in terms
     ([known_in_terms_have_values_statement]).

   The shape of the inputs, beyond what the merged statements
   suppose of inputs ([uses_know_the_source]): a use knows the
   variables that the source knows, and no other. So no variable is
   brought in from a use.

   The test on the answer ([kept_defined_at]): a variable that the
   analysis has a definition for, and that the source does not know,
   has a [Simple] at the index of the use. Such a variable is one
   that the join has made and kept; its value at a use is that of the
   [Simple] of its definition there, and the proof needs it to have
   one. The last phase of the join keeps a variable that the join
   has made if no variable of the target is to be an alias of it and
   it is mentioned more than once in the types that the join adds or
   is part of a relation (a variable mentioned once is replaced by
   its type). In the last example below the definition of such a
   variable lacks a [Simple] at a use: the types that were joined to
   make it are those of the other uses.

   The conditions on the run ([run_with_values]):
   - the static environment is valid ([statics_valid], which the
     statements about the meet's environment suppose);
   - the valuation gives a value to every variable that the use
     knows ([known_have_values]). What it is for a machine to satisfy
     an environment ([env_satisfies_strictly],
     FlambdaTypingEnvSpec.v) gives this only of the variables that
     may occur in terms ([bound_in_terms]); so it is had there for a
     use all of whose variables may occur in terms
     ([known_in_terms]), and otherwise it is for the caller's notion
     of satisfaction to say, of the variables that have gone out of
     scope and of those that exist only in types (for one that a
     join has kept, the last part of the sixth statement above is
     what the join gives);
   - the blocks that the variables that the use knows hold have tags
     in range ([blocks_have_tags], FlambdaJoinSpec.v: a rule of
     well-formed terms, decision D23).

   The test for recovering relations does not matter to these
   statements, as it does to those of FlambdaJoinRepairSpec.v: on
   these runs a variable that a relation is on has a value whichever
   the test. It is a variable that the source knows; or one that the
   join has made, which a variable of the source is to be an alias
   of, or which the last phase defines, and then its definition has
   a [Simple] at the use by the test on the answer.

   The instances that refute the contracts, and what excludes each
   ([counterexamples_excluded_statement]):
   - [Witness] (FlambdaJoinEnvSpec.v) and [In_terms]
     (FlambdaJoinRepairSpec.v): a use knows the variable [x], and
     the valuation gives it no value ([known_have_values] fails).
   - [Brought_in] (FlambdaJoinRepairSpec.v), an instance of the join
     that the meet calls: one of the two joined environments defines
     a variable that the first environment does not know, so
     [uses_know_the_source] fails of inputs made of them.

   What the join computes on inputs of the shape, by computation
   ([Arms]), with either of the two tests: the uses are the arms of
   a [Switch], each the source one scope further in which the
   scrutinee is the constant of the arm and each parameter is its
   argument.
   - The uses have to say so by equations. [Typing_env.add_alias]
     records that two [Simple]s are equal and gives the name that is
     no longer canonical no equation; the join reads the equations
     of the levels cut from the uses, so of uses made with it alone
     the join says nothing ([arms_without_equations_statement]). The
     meet's environment adds the equation of that name after the
     alias ([Meet_env.replace_concrete_equation], FlambdaMeetEnv.v),
     and so do the uses of the other examples.
   - A block in an arm and an immediate in the other
     ([arms_block_and_immediate_statement]): the parameter is a
     variant; the variable of the variant for the result of [Is_int]
     is the scrutinee, which is 0 at the first use and 1 at the
     second as that result is, so the join keeps no variable; the
     relation is recovered on the scrutinee; and the test on the
     answer passes.
   - Three arms and two parameters whose blocks have the same fields
     at the first two arms and that are immediates at the third
     ([arms_shared_field_statement]): the join keeps a variable for
     the field, mentioned by the types of both parameters, whose
     definition has no [Simple] at the third use; the test on the
     answer fails.
   These are computations of the join; the premises of the
   statements above are not shown of these inputs.

   What this does not cover.
   - A run in which a variable that the use knows has no value. The
     cause is in the proof and not known to be in the join: the
     equations are added through the meet's environment, whose
     statement supposes that each name of an equation has a value
     (FlambdaMeetEnvSpec.v,
     [meet_env_add_env_extension_sound_statement]). For the same
     reason the test on the answer is needed: a variable kept whose
     definition has no [Simple] at the use has no value in that run,
     and an equation is added on it. A possible way to remove both
     is a statement that the meet's environment may be given an
     equation on a variable that it has just defined and that has no
     value. It is not formulated here, and that it would be enough
     is not shown.
   - The range of the valuation that satisfies the target. It is the
     one that the meet's environment answers, and it is not said to
     be in range.
   - A use that is bottom, of which the contract says nothing either.

   Nothing is assumed beyond the premises of each statement. *)
