(* The extensions of a typing environment: equations on names, to be
   added to an environment.

   This file is the model's copy of
   middle_end/flambda2/types/env/typing_env_extension.ml: the functions
   on extensions and on extensions with extra variables, written as the
   OCaml is and under its names, in a module [Typing_env_extension]. It
   extracts. The type of an extension is that of the grammar of types
   ([env_extension], FlambdaTypeGrammar.v), since types hold
   extensions. What the functions answer is
   FlambdaTypingEnvExtensionSpec.v, whose header lists the differences
   from the OCaml; in short:
   - the equations are an association list, and the functions that add
     an equation take the earlier equation of the name out, so that a
     name has one equation, as in the OCaml's map;
   - the OCaml goes through the equations in the order of names; the
     model in the order of the list ([bindings]);
   - a fatal error of the OCaml that no flag guards is [None]; a check
     made only under a flag is a function of its own that answers
     whether the check passes ([check_equation], [invariant]);
   - a variable of the model has no kind, so [add_definition] cannot
     check the kind it is given. *)
