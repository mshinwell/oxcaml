(* What the answers of reification mean.

   This file is to be reviewed: what an answer is said to say of a
   value ([reification_holds]) and the statement. Reification is
   FlambdaReify.v, which is to be read against
   middle_end/flambda2/types/reify.ml; the provers that it asks are
   FlambdaProvers.v, with their statements in FlambdaProversSpec.v,
   whose header says what a typing environment, a valuation and a
   well-formed type are here.

   What the compiler does with an answer is
   [Reification.try_to_reify] (simplify/lifting/reification.ml), which
   simplify/simplify_named.ml calls on the result of a primitive that
   asks for it (the flag [try_reify] of [Simplify_primitive_result]),
   with the type that the environment has for the variable being
   bound.
   - [Simple s]: the term becomes [s], and the variable an alias of
     it; but if [s] is the variable being bound the term is left as it
     is, so that no binding is of itself.
   - [Lift]: if the variable is bound at the normal name mode and
     lifting is allowed there, a static constant is made of the answer
     ([create_static_const]) and bound to a symbol, a new one or one
     that an equal constant has already ([lift]), and the term becomes
     that symbol. Otherwise the term is left as it is.
   - [Invalid]: the term is invalid.
   - [Cannot_reify]: the term is left as it is.

   What is said, of a type, a typing environment and a valuation that
   satisfies the environment strictly.
   - [Simple s]: every value of the type is the value of [s] in the
     valuation. What FlambdaProversSpec.v says of a [Simple] that a
     prover answers holds of this one: that a term may use it is not
     said here.
   - [Lift (Immutable_block tag _ shape fields)]: every value of the
     type is a block of that tag and of that shape, whose fields are
     the values of the [Simple]s answered, all of them and in their
     order.
   - [Lift (Boxed_number k n)]: every value of the type is a boxed
     number of that kind, whose contents are the number [n].
   - [Invalid]: the type has no value.
   Nothing is said of [Cannot_reify], nor of [None], which is a stop
   of the compiler.

   What is not said.
   - That the value may be replaced by a symbol bound to a block or a
     boxed number made of what is answered. A block and a symbol bound
     to an equal block are two values of the model, so that the
     replacement keeps the meaning of the program is for the
     statement of the rewrite that lifts (decision D6).
   - Anything of [is_unique], or of the conditions under which the
     compiler lets a variable be a field of what is lifted
     ([Reify.var_allowed]: the environment in which the variable must
     be defined, the variables defined at toplevel, the symbol
     projections, the allocation mode and
     [Provers.never_holds_locally_allocated_values]). They are
     transcribed; allocation modes and scopes of lifting have no
     meaning in the denotation of types (FlambdaTypeMeaningSpec.v).
   - Anything under the notion of satisfaction that exempts the names
     that hold poison: reification trusts what the environment says
     of a name, as the provers do (discrepancy T6-1).

   The type is to be well formed ([well_formed_input] of
   FlambdaProversSpec.v), for the numbers of the immediates of a
   variant and of a type of naked immediates, which
   [Provers.meet_naked_immediates] reads.

   The statement of soundness has the premise
   [expand_head_sound_assumed], as in FlambdaProversSpec.v, until the
   proof of the workstream on meet is under this branch. The statement
   on kinds and the examples have not.

   The proofs are in FlambdaReifyProofs.v, which needs no review. *)

(* What an answer of reification says of a value. *)
(* CR mshinwell: nothing here says that lifting is right. The answer
   [Lift] says what the value is, not that a static constant made of
   it may take its place: the model tells a block from a symbol bound
   to an equal block, and it has no allocation modes, which are what
   [Reify.var_allowed] guards. It would be wrong to read the
   statement as the soundness of what [Reification.try_to_reify] does
   with [Lift]. Decision D6. *)
