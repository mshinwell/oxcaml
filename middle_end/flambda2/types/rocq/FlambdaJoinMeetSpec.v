(* What is stated of the join put together with the meet
   (FlambdaJoinMeet.v).

   This file is to be reviewed: the statements. The proofs are in
   FlambdaJoinMeetProofs.v, which needs no review.

   - The conversion between the two transcriptions of expanded types
     keeps the type and the kind ([join_expanded_to_type_statement]).
   - The parameters fixed there have what the statements about the
     join of environments suppose of parameters
     ([join_parameters_sound_statement]): [fresh_avoids],
     [parameters_type_eqb_sound], [env_extension_eqb_sound],
     [expand_const_sound].
   - The expansion of heads meets the contract that the join of types
     supposes of it ([expand_head_for_join_sound_statement]), by the
     statements of FlambdaExpandHeadSpec.v. (The reduction of heads of
     naked immediates meets its contract by
     [reduce_head_of_kind_naked_immediate_sound_statement] of
     FlambdaMeetStepsSpec.v, which is that contract.)
   - So what the join adds to the target is true
     ([model_join_true_statement]): [join_adds_true] of
     FlambdaJoinDefineSpec.v for [model_join], with the premises of
     [join_with_true_statement] on the inputs and none on a join of
     types or on parameters. It is for any choices, any depth and any
     fuel, and for the functions of [Meet_env]; as there, nothing is
     said of what those functions answer.

   - The variables that the join defines, in the environment of the
     meet ([variables_defined_kept_statement],
     [target_variables_defined_statement]): defining variables that
     the environment does not know, each once, keeps it
     ([meet_env_kept], FlambdaMeetEnvSpec.v), and the environment
     answered knows them, at their kinds, and nothing else that it
     did not know. None of them may occur in a term
     ([variables_defined_not_in_terms_statement]). So, for a valid
     state of the join whose source is
     the typing environment of the environment given: the environment
     in which the variables brought in and some of the variables made
     are defined knows exactly the variables that the target is to
     have ([in_final_target], FlambdaJoinFitsSpec.v), each at the
     kind that the state has for it.
   - So the names of the equations that the last phase adds, and the
     variables of their types, are known to the environment that the
     first extension is added to
     ([last_phase_names_known_statement]): by
     [last_phase_adds_in_scope_statement] of FlambdaJoinAddsSpec.v.
     This is about that environment, before the first extension is
     added: that the second extension is added to an environment
     that still knows them needs the first to fit entirely (kinds
     and well-formedness too): [last_phase_kept_statement], below.
   - And their kinds are known to it
     ([last_phase_kinds_known_statement]): the name of each equation
     is of the kind of its type there, and the type is kinded there
     (each alias of the type is of the kind at which it stands), by
     [last_phase_adds_kinded_statement] of FlambdaJoinKindsSpec.v.
     For an alias that is a symbol: the state says that an
     environment joined knows it (FlambdaJoinSpec.v,
     [simple_of_kind_in_target]), and the statement supposes that
     the source knows every symbol that an environment joined knows
     ([symbols_of_joined_envs_in_source]).
   - So the two extensions are added as the statements about the
     meet's environment suppose (FlambdaMeetEnvSpec.v,
     [add_env_extension_keeps_statement]), and each environment on
     the way to the target is the one before, extended, and one in
     which a meet may be made ([last_phase_kept_statement]). This
     has a premise that this file does not show of the join
     ([types_fit_otherwise]): the types of the equations are well
     formed, and the names of the equations inside them are of the
     kinds of their types. (For the join that the meet calls it is
     shown in FlambdaJoinMeetFitsSpec.v.) The rest of what an
     extension must have
     to fit
     ([env_extension_fits], [env_extension_kinded]) is from the
     statements above: the names and the variables are known, the
     names are of the kinds of their types, the aliases are of their
     kinds.
   - So the join that the meet calls ([model_join_scoped_envs]) has
     the conclusions of the contract that the meet has for its join
     ([join_scoped_envs_sound], FlambdaMeetSpec.v) that are not about
     values ([join_scoped_envs_keeps],
     [model_join_scoped_envs_keeps_statement]): the result is the
     environment given, extended; a meet may be made in it; a
     variable of the result that no environment given knows is none
     of the names to avoid of the environment given and is among
     those of the result; a variable of the result that the
     environment given does not know may not occur in a term (the
     join defines its variables at the mode of the variables that
     exist only in types, and so do the meets that it calls); and a
     [Simple] that the result knows is of
     the kind that an environment joined has it at. The premises are
     those of the contract, and one more
     ([join_adds_types_that_fit_otherwise]: the premise
     [types_fit_otherwise] of the statement before, for the join's
     own run), which is shown of this join in
     FlambdaJoinMeetFitsSpec.v
     ([model_join_adds_types_that_fit_otherwise_statement]); that
     file has this statement, and the next about values, without
     the premise.
   - The conclusion of the contract about values, on the runs that
     have conditions. For the last phase
     ([last_phase_satisfied_statement]): given also a meet of
     expanded types that has its contract on values, and an
     environment whose names to avoid have those of the state, a
     valuation that satisfies the source and an environment joined
     extends to one that satisfies the target, and the equations of
     the target are on names that have a value where those of the
     source were, if the static environment is valid
     ([statics_valid]) and the run has the
     three conditions under which the equations added are true
     (FlambdaJoinDefineSpec.v, FlambdaJoinAddsSpec.v) and every name
     of an equation added has a value in the valuation of the target
     that the state gives. The names to avoid are needed: the
     valuation answered has what the additions make of the variables
     of the target and what the valuation given has elsewhere, and a
     variable that an environment joined knows and that a meet of
     the additions defined anew could have two values. And for the
     join that the meet calls
     ([model_join_scoped_envs_satisfied_statement]), under the
     premises of the contract, with the states of the join named.
     Not here: the conclusion on every run of the contract. The
     conditions are not among its premises and do not follow from
     them (see the CRs at the conditions in FlambdaJoinDefineSpec.v,
     and at [keeps_equations_valued] in FlambdaMeetSpec.v).
   - The join that Simplify calls ([model_join]), in the environment
     of the meet, on inputs of the contract of FlambdaJoinSpec.v.
     Supposed of the meet of expanded types that the join gives the
     meet's environment: what the meet's contract for its join
     supposes of the one it is given ([meet_expanded_head_keeps],
     and [meet_expanded_head_sound] for values). They are premises
     here, and not shown of [model_meet_expanded_head]: the meet has
     them by its own theorems only from a join that has the whole of
     [join_scoped_envs_sound], which the join of this model has not
     on every run (the item before). Supposed also: a meet may be
     made in the source ([typing_env_fits]; the contract supposes
     only its invariant and that it has no bottom type); the uses
     have the names of the source at its kinds
     ([uses_agree_with_source_on_kinds]); and the types that the
     last phase adds fit otherwise ([types_fit_otherwise]). The run
     is named ([model_join_run]). Then
     ([model_join_keeps_statement]) a meet may be made in the
     target, so it is well formed and has no bottom type; it keeps
     the source ([join_keeps_source]); and the variables that it has
     and the source has not are as the contract says
     ([join_introduces]). And the analysis speaks of the uses as the
     contract says ([model_join_describes_uses_statement]:
     [analysis_describes_uses]). These are five of the six parts of
     [join_guarantees]; the sixth is on the runs that have the
     conditions. And ([model_join_admits_use_statement]) at a
     use that is not bottom, for a static environment that is valid
     ([statics_valid], which the statements about the meet's
     environment suppose and [join_admits_use] does not) and on a
     run that has the conditions of the item before, a valuation
     that satisfies the use and the source
     extends to one that satisfies the target and agrees with it on
     what the use knows and on what the source knows, and in which
     the definitions of the analysis hold: the conclusion of
     [join_admits_use], for those static environments and on those
     runs. (The definitions hold in the
     valuation of the state, [model_join_true_statement], and each
     is of a variable that the target has,
     [last_phase_adds_definitions_statement] of
     FlambdaJoinAddsSpec.v.) Not here: the conditions on runs read
     as those of the contract ([values_are_read]). The statement
     about valuations is also made for any meet of expanded types
     that has the two contracts, in the place of the model's
     ([model_join_with], [model_join_with_admits_use_statement]):
     the model's meet is not shown to have the second, and may not
     have it, and then the statement at the model's meet says
     nothing. A meet that has both is the one made with the join
     that forgets ([meet_with_forgetful_join_has_contracts_statement]).

   Examples of what [model_join] computes are in
   FlambdaJoinMeetExamplesSpec.v. *)
