(* Renaming the aliases of the typing environment, and their free
   variables.

   This file is to be reviewed: the renamings ([rename_name],
   [rename_aliases], [rename_binding_times], [rename_resolver],
   [rename_alias_set], [rename_add_result]), [aliases_free_variables],
   and the statements. The compiler has nothing to compare them with:
   [Aliases.t] has neither [apply_renaming] nor [free_names] there. They
   are here because everything that holds names is to have its renaming
   and its free names, and the functions on it are to commute with
   renaming (FlambdaNominalSpec.v; the compiler's directory nominal/).

   A renaming (FlambdaNominalSpec.renaming) permutes variables. It does
   not touch symbols or constants. The structure is renamed in all three
   of its maps, keys and values. What the functions of the aliases take
   of the typing environment is renamed with it: the map of binding
   times and name modes in its keys, and the resolver by the inverse
   renaming of its argument, so that a name keeps its binding time and
   its name mode when it is renamed.

   The free variables of the structure are every variable written in it:
   in the keys and in the values of the three maps, in a binding that is
   shadowed and in the key of an empty set of aliases too. Nothing in
   the structure binds a name. They are more than the variables the
   structure speaks of ([aliases_mention], FlambdaEnvAliasesSpec.v),
   which are those that a query can show: a renaming that fixes the
   variables the structure speaks of may still change it, as written,
   where it renames a key that no query reads. The laws of the renaming
   are stated with the first; what the structure means depends on the
   second only (FlambdaEnvAliasesSpec.v, [respected_coincide]).

   The statements:
   - the renamings of the structure act as the renamings do: identity,
     composition, and two renamings that rename every variable alike
     rename a structure alike;
   - the free variables of the renamed structure are the renamed free
     variables, and a renaming that fixes the free variables of a
     structure leaves it as it is, with [=];
   - the variables the structure speaks of are among its free
     variables, and the names the renamed structure speaks of are the
     renamed names;
   - the equality test of simples, the order, the queries and
     [Aliases.add] commute with renaming, and respect and the invariant
     are kept by it.
   No statement about a function has a premise: the functions compare
   names for equality only and read binding times through the map and
   the resolver. In particular where two aliases are equally early the
   model takes the first of a list, which renaming keeps; the compiler
   takes the one that an order on names puts first, which renaming need
   not keep (FlambdaEnvAliasesSpec.v, "Differences").

   The structure is an instance, for variables and with [=] as its
   equality, of the interface for things that contain names
   (FlambdaNameAbstractionSpec.v, after the compiler's
   [Contains_names.S]): [aliases_contains_names], which has the laws of
   that interface ([aliases_nominal_statement]).

   The proofs are in FlambdaEnvAliasesRenamingProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
