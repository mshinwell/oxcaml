(* Uses made from the source, and the premises on the inputs of the
   join.

   This file is to be reviewed: the definitions and the statements.
   The proofs are in FlambdaJoinUsesProofs.v, which needs no review.

   What it is for. The statements of FlambdaJoinInTermsSpec.v about
   the join that Simplify calls have premises about the inputs:
   those of the five parts
   ([model_join_with_guarantees_on_inputs_statement]:
   [join_inputs_well_formed], [uses_kinded],
   [uses_agree_with_source_on_kinds], [uses_fit_otherwise], and that
   a meet may be made in the source), the shape that the sixth part
   supposes ([uses_know_the_source]), and what the statement in the
   machine supposes ([terms_in_scope_at_uses], FlambdaJoinSpec.v).
   This file gives a way of making uses of which they all hold, with
   side conditions on the environment before each step and on what
   the step is given.

   The uses. A use is made from the source ([made_from]) by going one
   scope further ([Typing_env.increment_scope]) and then, any number
   of times and in any order, by one of two steps.
   - A variable is made equal to a [Simple] ([alias_with_equation]):
     [Typing_env.add_alias] of the two, and then the equation of the
     name that is no longer canonical, an alias to the one that is.
     The meet's environment adds that equation after such an alias
     ([Meet_env.record_demotion], FlambdaMeetEnv.v), and the uses of
     the examples of FlambdaJoinInTermsSpec.v are made so
     ([Arms.alias] with the equation, which is this function:
     [alias_with_equation_is_arms_alias_statement]); without it the
     join says nothing of the two
     ([arms_without_equations_statement], same file). The two are to
     be canonical, different and of one kind. Either may be the one
     that is no longer canonical afterwards.
   - A variable is given a type that is not an alias
     ([Typing_env.replace_equation]). The type is to fit the
     environment ([type_fits], FlambdaMeetSpec.v: it is well formed,
     the environment knows its variables, and it is kinded there), to
     be of the kind of the variable, and to be neither obviously
     unknown nor obviously bottom.
   No step defines a variable. So a type that is given speaks of
   variables that the source knows: a caller whose types mention
   variables defined between the source and the application has them
   removed first ([project_variables_out], FlambdaTypeProject.v,
   whose statements are in FlambdaJoinFitsSpec.v and
   FlambdaJoinDefineSpec.v, is one way).

   The statement ([uses_made_from_source_statement]): if a meet may
   be made in the source ([typing_env_fits], FlambdaMeetSpec.v), the
   variables to avoid include those that the source knows, and each
   use is made from the source, then the inputs with these uses, cut
   after the scope of the source, have the six premises; and a use is
   bottom exactly if the source is.

   The examples ([arms_made_from_source_statement]): a meet may be
   made in the source of the examples of FlambdaJoinInTermsSpec.v,
   and each of their uses with equations is made from it. So the
   side conditions hold of some uses; and by the statement above the
   six premises hold of inputs made of these uses, with variables to
   avoid that include those of that source.

   What this does not give: the other premises of the sixth part,
   which are not about the inputs. They are the two contracts of the
   meet that is given, the test on the answer ([kept_defined_at]) and
   the conditions on the run ([run_with_values]).

   Nothing is assumed beyond the premises of each statement. *)
