(* Proofs of the statement of FlambdaUnboxTogetherSpec.v. Nothing here
   needs review.

   For one sort of box, the term and its result run in step under a
   relation of states ([state_rel]), as in
   FlambdaUntagParamsProofs.v: the same expression, where neither run
   is in a term that the pass rewrote; or an expression that the test
   accepts and the same rewritten, under variables that agree but for
   the unboxed ones, and under continuations that are closures of a
   handler and of that handler rewritten. An unboxed variable holds,
   in the second run, a value of the kind of the number that is what
   [Unbox_number] has on what it holds in the first, if it has a
   value, whatever is bound later ([unboxes_to]): the first run may
   hold a box or the symbol of a static one. What is known holds of
   the variables of the first run ([facts_hold]), which is what says
   that an argument that the term shows to be a box is given its
   number. That the result refines the term is then
   FlambdaSemanticsProofs.simulation_refines. *)
