(* Inlining, in the body of code, the direct calls of the other code of
   its group: a normalisation that refines.

   This file is to be reviewed: [inline_sibling_calls] and
   [inline_in_group], which are to be extracted and run by the
   validation of middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/ once a round of
   it uses them (none does yet), and the statements.

   FlambdaNormaliseSpec.inline_calls inlines a direct call of code that
   it knows. Down a term it knows the code that the groups of static
   bindings around it have bound; in the body of code, that is the code
   of the groups around the group that binds it, and not the code of its
   own group. A round of the validation ends by making one group of
   the groups of static bindings that follow one another
   (FlambdaNormaliseSpec.merge_statics), as Simplify does, so after a
   round much of the code of a unit is in one group. So a call in the
   body of code that becomes direct during one round, as that of a
   local function given to a function that is inlined does, finds its
   code in its own group from the next round on, and is not inlined,
   where Simplify inlines it.

   [inline_in_group] goes through the bindings of a group in order. The
   body of each piece of code is rewritten by
   FlambdaNormaliseSpec.inline_calls, with the other code of the group
   known: that of the bindings before it as they have just been
   rewritten, and that of the bindings after it as they are. The
   binding itself is not among what is known. So in a group whose code
   ids are distinct, as those of a well-formed term are, a call of code
   to itself is left. (If another binding of the group has the same
   code id, the code of that one is known under the id. A group that
   binds a code id twice has no meaning, and the statements are of
   every term.) [inline_sibling_calls] does this at every group of a
   term that is not in the body of code or in the handler of a
   recursive continuation.

   Why one binding at a time. When the body of code runs, the static
   environment binds the code of its group as the group now has it.
   What is inlined must be that code. With one binding rewritten and
   the others as they are, the others are the same on the two sides,
   and they are what the rewritten body has inlined.

   The code whose calls are left ([kept]) is an argument, as for
   FlambdaNormaliseSpec.inline_calls, and the statements hold whatever
   it is. The validation is to give the code that calls itself
   through other code, so that a round does not unroll a recursion:
   that is the policy of the test tool, and no statement supposes it.

   The proofs are in FlambdaInlineSiblingsProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
