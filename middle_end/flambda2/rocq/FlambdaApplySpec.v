(* Function calls: what is known of a call, and inlining.

   This file is to be reviewed: [let_params] and [inlined_body], against
   what the simplifier builds when it inlines a call
   (simplify/inlining/inlining_transforms.ml), and the statements.

   - A call whose callee is a closure of known code may be made direct
     ([apply_indirect_known_statement]).
   - Inlining a direct call is a refinement ([inline_statement]): the call
     becomes the body of the code, with the closure and the arguments
     bound by [Let] to [my_closure] and the parameters, and with the
     code's return and exception continuations renamed to those of the
     call. It is a refinement and not an equivalence because the call is
     undefined when the callee is not a closure of the code named.

   The code must be what the code id of the call is bound to: in the
   static environment ([inline_statement]), or by a [Let_static] around
   the call ([inline_let_code_statement]). The other premises
   ([inlinable]) are the conditions for this to be the same computation:
   - the code is closed: the free variables of its body are its parameters
     and [my_closure], and its free continuations are its return and
     exception continuations. In the call the body runs under these only;
     inlined, it runs under everything in scope at the call;
   - the bindings do not capture: [my_closure] and the parameters are not
     free in the arguments. The simplifier ensures it by taking fresh
     names for them, which FlambdaNominalSpec.v allows;
   - the arities agree;
   - the body binds nothing static. The call of code that does is
     undefined, wherever it is; inlined at toplevel, the body would have
     a meaning.
   The renaming is a permutation, so a call whose return and exception
   continuations are one continuation, of code in which they are two, is
   not covered; otherwise there is such a renaming
   ([inline_renaming_exists_statement]).

   Nothing here decides whether to inline.

   The proofs are in FlambdaApplyProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
