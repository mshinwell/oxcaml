(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceSpec.v. Nothing
   here needs review.

   Each rewrite is taken as the two of FlambdaEquivarianceProofs.v are:
   one lemma for each function the rewrite is made of, saying that the
   function commutes with the action, and one recursion over expressions
   (and over handlers, bindings and code where the rewrite goes into
   them). A test that compares names for equality answers the same on
   the renamed names because a renaming is injective. *)

(* The term before normalised is, under the renaming, that term under a
   second renaming; the term before with the liftings made in turn is
   that term under a third, since each normalisation after a lifting
   avoids the continuations of the units of the liftings. The placing
   of continuations and the tidying, which come next, the removal of
   static bindings,
   the removal of value slots, the moving up of the bindings of code
   and the ordering of static bindings commute with each of them,
   whatever renames the pattern, and keep scope; so the
   two renamings rename the free names of each term that is compared
   alike. The term after is under the first renaming throughout: its
   normalisation and the putting of its code first commute with it.
   The term before may be under a renaming of its own from the start,
   if that renaming does to its free names, and to the continuations
   of the units and of the loops, what the first does. *)

Theorem validate_unit_equivariant : validate_unit_equivariant_statement.
Proof.
  intros r rounds unused slots G Ls kept before after Hclosed.
  apply validate_unit_renamed_alike; [ exact Hclosed | | ].
  - split; intros name _; reflexivity.
  - intros k _. reflexivity.
