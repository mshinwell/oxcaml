(* The validation asked again, with the aliases followed by a function
   that knows what symbols are bound to.

   This file is to be reviewed: the definitions and the statements.

   FlambdaValidateSpec.validate_unit normalises the term before
   Simplify and the term after in rounds, and compares them. In each
   round it follows aliases with the function of
   ../types/rocq/FlambdaAliasesSpec.v, which knows nothing of what a
   symbol is bound to. The function of
   ../types/rocq/FlambdaEnvAliasesFollowSpec.v knows the closures that
   the static bindings in sight bind symbols to: it makes an indirect
   call of such a symbol the direct call of its code, puts in the
   place of the projection of a value slot from such a symbol what the
   slot holds, and in the place of the projection of a function slot
   the symbol that the set names for that slot. It also knows the
   closure that a [Let] binds a variable to when the closure is one of
   a set whose function slots are named, which the first does not.
   Units that are not validated with the first are validated with the
   second: those in which Simplify has used what a symbol is bound to,
   or what such a variable is bound to.

   The second function does not go into the bodies of code. Here it is
   run on the term and then on the body of each piece of code that the
   term binds ([follow_aliases_knowing]), in a body from nothing
   known: what the term around the code knows of a symbol is not used
   in the body, and what a [Let] of the body binds is.

   The second does not take the place of the first in the rounds. The
   normalisation of the term before has more rewrites than that of the
   term after: it may refine, and the other must keep the behaviour.
   Where the second function makes a call direct in both terms, the
   normalisation of the term before goes on from there (it inlines the
   call, moves the continuations that are applied once to where they
   are applied, and folds), and that of the term after may stop
   earlier (it inlines a call only where the kinds of the arguments
   are sure, and leaves a continuation that is applied once where it
   is). A unit whose two terms are the same once normalised by the
   first function, both left with the same indirect calls, is then
   not validated by the second. The example
   middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/indirect_higher_order.fl is
   one: with its two calls of a symbol made direct and inlined in
   both terms, the term before is folded to a constant, and the term
   after is left with a continuation applied once to a constant.

   So the validation is asked twice. First as it is. Then, if it
   fails, on the two terms normalised by rounds in front of each of
   which the second function is run ([normalise_knowing]): the round
   of the term before for the term before, the round of the term
   after for the term after. With a round that refines, the term so
   normalised refines the term, and with a round that is an
   equivalence it is equivalent to the term
   ([normalise_knowing_refines_statement],
   [normalise_knowing_equivalent_statement]); so if the second of the
   two normalised terms refines the first, by whatever
   FlambdaValidateSpec.v accepts, the term after refines the term
   before ([validate_knowing_sound_statement], for a unit run on its
   own from empty environments, and
   [validate_knowing_sound_everywhere_statement], under all
   environments). Nothing of FlambdaValidateSpec.v changes, and what it
   validates today it validates still.

   In those statements the rounds are arguments, and [validate_unit]
   is not named: they say what follows from what it concludes, for any
   round that refines and any round that is an equivalence.

   The second asking itself is [validate_unit_knowing]: [validate_unit]
   of the two terms so normalised, the term before with
   FlambdaValidateSpec.normalise_before_round_avoiding, which refines
   (FlambdaValidateProofs.normalise_before_round_avoiding_refines), and
   the term after with FlambdaValidateSpec.normalise_after_round, which
   is an equivalence (normalise_after_round_equivalent). The round of
   the term before makes names, and is told not to make one that is a
   continuation of the unit of a lifting
   (FlambdaValidateSpec.unit_continuations) or the continuation given
   for a loop. It is the means that [validate_unit] uses for its
   rounds after a lifting, which are told to avoid the continuations
   of the units of the liftings: a lifting is made only if what it
   makes is a well-formed unit, which goes by the names of the
   continuations of its unit. Those rounds are not told the
   continuations of the loops, since inside [validate_unit] the loops
   are made before any round. Here they are still to be made
   (FlambdaLoopifySpec.loopify_unit, which binds the continuation of
   each loop, runs inside [validate_unit], after this normalisation),
   so the round avoids those continuations too. What it accepts is
   correct of the two terms as they were given
   ([validate_unit_knowing_sound_statement],
   [validate_unit_knowing_sound_everywhere_statement]). So what the
   test tool reports as validated at the second asking is correct by
   one theorem, as what it reports at the first is, and not by how the
   tool puts proved pieces together: the tool calls
   [validate_unit_knowing] on the two terms as it converted them. The
   guesses that it passes (the static bindings to remove, the loops,
   the liftings, the value slots) are not trusted, here as there. The
   function takes the arguments of [validate_unit] and of the two
   rounds; whoever gives one of those an argument more gives it here
   too.

   Renaming and scope. The validation is stated of terms up to their
   bound names, so a function on terms that it runs is to commute with
   renaming, at least up to the names that it makes, and to keep scope
   (FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceSpec.v). [normalise_knowing] does, for
   a round that does: [normalise_knowing_keeps_scope_statement],
   [normalise_knowing_equivariant_statement] and
   [normalise_knowing_equivariant_up_to_statement]; and, for a round
   that is given continuations that the names it makes are to avoid,
   [normalise_knowing_equivariant_up_to_avoiding_statement]. At one
   round they are the same of [knowing_round]. They rest on the laws
   of the function that follows aliases
   (FlambdaEnvAliasesFollowSpec.rename_follow_aliases_empty_statement,
   FlambdaEnvAliasesFollowScopeSpec.v), on those of a rewrite taken
   into the bodies of code (FlambdaKeepsScopeSpec.v and
   FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceSpec.v, for [rewrite_code]) and on
   those of composition and iteration of
   FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceSpec.v. They are laws of
   the normalisation. What follows from them for the second asking is
   that its verdict does not depend on the names of the unit, where
   the code of the term before is closed
   ([validate_unit_knowing_equivariant_statement]); the round of the
   term before avoids the continuations named above for that.

   The proofs are in FlambdaValidateKnowingProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)

(* CR mshinwell: the function of FlambdaAliasesSpec.v stays in the
   rounds, and the validation is asked a second time with the new one
   in front of each round. The first can go, and the new one take its
   place in the rounds, when two things are done. The normalisation of
   the term after is to reach what that of the term before reaches on
   indirect_higher_order.fl once the calls are direct, or the term
   before is to keep the calls that Simplify kept (the list of code
   that is not to be inlined), so that the example is validated with
   the new function alone. And the pass for loops
   (FlambdaLoopAliasesSpec.v), which is written with the typing
   environment of FlambdaAliasesSpec.v, is to be written with what the
   new function knows. *)

(* It answers the same on a pair of terms and on the pair renamed, the

   says of [validate_unit]. The round of the term before makes names,

   pair, the renamed one only up to those names; and the liftings and
   the loops speak of continuations that the term need not mention.
   The round is told to avoid those continuations, so the renaming
   that [normalise_knowing_equivariant_up_to_avoiding_statement] gives
   does to them what the first does, which is what
   FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceSpec.validate_unit_renamed_alike_statement
   asks. The round of the term after makes no name. Nothing is said of
   a term before with open code. The two statements above do not rest
