(* The statements about binders: that the names a binder binds may be
   renamed, and that a binding that is not used may be removed.

   This file is to be reviewed: the statements.

   The free names of a term are given by one function for each sort
   (FlambdaBindersSpec.free_variables_of_expr and
   free_continuations_of_expr), which goes into code. Each statement
   here is written with those:
   - a renaming that fixes the free names of the scope of a binder,
     other than the names bound (FlambdaAlphaSpec.fixes_names), may be
     applied to the bound names and the scope
     ([rename_let_canonical_statement] and the five after it);
   - a binding whose name is not among the free names of its scope may
     be removed ([unused_let_canonical_statement] and the two after
     it). These three are corollaries of the statements of
     FlambdaNominalSpec.v, which say more;
   - a renaming of the variables of a term and of its environment that
     fixes its free continuations does not change its behaviour
     ([rename_variables_equivalent_canonical_statement]).
   The rules of FlambdaAlphaSpec.alpha_equivalent are the first of
   these, with [alpha_equivalent] for [expr_equivalent]. The binders of
   code are in FlambdaNominalSpec.v ([rename_code_binders_statement]).

   The statements that rename were in FlambdaNominalSpec.v and
   FlambdaAlphaSpec.v, written with the relations [var_free_in_expr]
   and [cont_free_in_expr] of FlambdaNominalSpec.v, which do not go
   into code. Those older forms are no longer statements of a Spec
   file. They are lemmas of FlambdaNominalProofs.v and
   FlambdaAlphaProofs.v, under the names they had ([rename_let] and so
   on, which is why the names here end in [_canonical]), because proofs
   use them. Each statement here is proved from the older one and from
   FlambdaFreeNamesSpec.var_free_among_statement and
   cont_free_among_statement: what is free by the relation is among the
   list, whatever the code. So the premise about names here asks at
   least as much as the older one did, and the two are the same where
   code is closed (FlambdaFreeNamesSpec.var_free_agrees_statement).

   What that means for each sort of statement:
   - those that rename ask that the code is closed, so they say what
     the older forms said;
   - the three about a binding that is not used ask nothing of the
     code, and here the premise asks more than that of
     FlambdaNominalSpec.unused_let_statement and the two after it,
     which are written with the relations and are still statements. Of
     a term whose code is not closed those say more: a name that occurs
     only in code is not free by the relation, and the binding may
     still be removed, since the machine never lets code read a name
     that it does not bind. The rewrites of the validator that remove
     bindings are proved from them. Of a well-formed term, whose code
     is closed, the two forms say the same.

   Nothing is trusted here. The proofs are in
   FlambdaCanonicalFreeNamesProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
