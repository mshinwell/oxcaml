(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaStaticsScopeSpec.v. Nothing here
   needs review.

   Each rewrite is shown to give a term that keeps the scope of the
   term it is given (FlambdaScopedProofs.scoped), by recursion on the
   term with the lemmas of that file for each construct. A group whose
   bindings are permuted has the same closed code and the same free
   names; a group with bindings removed has no more of either. The
   lemmas for FlambdaUnaliasParamsSpec.unalias_params are in
   FlambdaUnaliasParamsNamesProofs.v. *)
