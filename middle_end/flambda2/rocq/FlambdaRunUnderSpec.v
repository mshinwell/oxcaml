(* A unit run under a continuation environment, and the unit run on its
   own.

   This file is to be reviewed: [same_but_conts], [static_code_closed],
   [step_result_behaves] and the four statements.

   A unit leaves when it applies a way out: a continuation that its
   continuation environment did not bind where the name was resolved
   ([FlambdaSemanticsSpec.Outer]; the name may be bound elsewhere in the
   unit). Run on its own, from an empty continuation environment, that
   is an exit. Run from a continuation environment [base], it is the
   application of what [base] binds the name to, if it binds it. Until
   then the two runs are the same run: the same term, variables, static
   environment and heap at each step, and continuation environments
   that differ only in what stands for a way out. So the run from
   [base] is the run of the unit on its own and then, if that exits,
   what [base] binds the continuation of the exit to, applied to the
   values of the exit under the static environment and the heap that
   the unit left.

   The code that the term binds is to be closed
   (FlambdaBindersSpec.code_closed), and so is the code of the static
   environment that the run starts from ([static_code_closed]). A call
   gives the body of code the continuations of the call and no other,
   so a body that applied a continuation that it does not bind would
   leave by it whatever [base] binds it to, and the statements would be
   false of such a term. Nothing is asked of [base].

   The run starts from any variables, static environment and heap, and
   from no continuation: so from the empty static environment and heap,
   and from the static environment of a unit's imports
   (FlambdaImportsSpec.imports_statics), neither of which binds code.
   The statements are what lets a statement about what a unit leaves at
   its exit (FlambdaExitWorldSpec.exits_world) be used of the unit
   followed by something that runs on what it left.

   The proofs are in FlambdaRunUnderProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
