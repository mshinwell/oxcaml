(* A parameter of a continuation that holds a tagged immediate, and
   that its handler has bound again at its head, gets a twin that
   holds the number, where every application can give one: a
   normalisation that refines.

   This file is to be reviewed: [twin_expr], [twin_ok], [twin_at] and
   [twin_untag_at] and what they are made of, and the two statements.
   The pass is for the term before Simplify, in the validation of
   middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/, where it is to come after
   FlambdaShadowParamsSpec.shadow_params and
   FlambdaRenameApartSpec.rename_apart_avoiding; nothing applies it
   yet. Nothing is believed of the positions that it is to be run
   with ([twin_positions]): the statements are about any positions.

   Simplify unboxes the parameters of a continuation
   (simplify/unboxing/): where the type of a parameter says that it is
   a tagged immediate, the continuation gets a parameter more for the
   number, each application gets the number as an argument more, and
   the tagged parameter goes only if nothing else uses it
   ([Unbox_continuation_params.make_decisions],
   [Apply_cont_rewrite.make_rewrite]). So for a flag that a loop both
   tests and keeps,

     let any = ref false in
     for i = 0 to n do any := !any || i > limit done;
     !any

   the continuation where the arms of [||] meet has, after Simplify,
   the flag as a value, which is what the loop returns, and the flag
   as a number, which is what it tests.
   FlambdaUntagParamsSpec.untag_params makes a parameter the number
   where it is only untagged or passed on, and leaves it where
   something else uses it. This pass makes the second parameter.

   It makes no name. The term that it is given has, at the head of
   the handler, a [Let] of a variable to the parameter
   (FlambdaShadowParamsSpec.shadow_params binds the parameter again
   to itself, and FlambdaRenameApartSpec.rename_apart_avoiding gives
   that binder a name of its own):

     k (p) = let p' = p in body

   The rewrite ([twin_expr], for the positions given, which say for
   the name of a continuation which of its parameters get a twin)
   takes that [Let] away, makes [p'] the parameter at the position
   and [p] one more parameter, after those that the continuation had:

     k (p', p) = body

   The twins of a handler are in the order of their positions, and
   have the kinds that the handler gave the parameters
   ([twin_params_list], [twin_metadata]). An application of the
   continuation gives each twin the argument that it gives at the
   position, a second time ([twin_args]). So [p'] and [p] hold the
   same value, and until one of them is bound again ([twinned], the
   pairs in scope):
   - an argument at a position that has a twin, if it is such a [p'],
     is given the second time as its [p] ([twin_simple]);
   - a [Let] of the untagging of such a [p'] is a [Let] of the
     untagging of its [p] ([twin_named]).
   Nothing else changes: every other use of [p'] stays.

   What the rewrite asks ([twin_ok]):
   - the handler of a continuation whose positions have twins begins
     with the [Let]s of those parameters, in their order ([head_ok]);
     a [Let] of a variable to another variable may stand before each,
     and stays, if it binds and reads none of those parameters and
     none of the variables that take their places. Such a [Let] is
     there where the head of a handler binds two parameters again and
     only the second gets a twin: of
       k (p, q) = let p' = p in let q' = q in body
     the rewrite with a twin for [q] alone makes
       k (p, q', q) = let p' = p in body;
   - the new parameters of every handler are distinct
     ([handler_twins_fit]);
   - no call returns to a continuation that has a twin, and none
     raises to one: a call gives a continuation values that the term
     does not show.
   Scopes are as in FlambdaUntagParamsSpec.v: the positions go by the
   name of a continuation, and [active] says which continuations in
   scope have twins. The handlers of recursive continuations are gone
   into; the bodies of code are not:
   FlambdaNormaliseSpec.rewrite_code takes a pass there.

   [twin_at] is the term rewritten where the test passes for the
   whole term, and the term as it is otherwise. The result refines
   the term ([twin_at_refines_statement]) under all environments,
   whatever the positions. Why it holds: a parameter and its twin
   hold the one value that the application gave twice. The variable
   of a [Let] that went is a parameter in the result, and holds
   there, from the entry of the handler, what the [Let] gives it in
   the term; nothing reads it before the term has run that [Let]
   (the test asks it of the [Let]s that stay at the head), and the
   two runs have the same values in every other variable. The term
   takes one step more for each [Let] that went. It is stated as a
   refinement, which
   is what a rewrite of the term before owes: where the kind that a
   [Let] taken away gave its variable is not that of the value, the
   term is undefined and the result may run.

   The twins hold the value still. [twin_untag_at] is [twin_expr]
   followed by FlambdaUntagParamsSpec.untag_expr at the positions of
   the twins ([twin_sites]), which makes each twin the number, an
   argument for it the naked constant or the variable whose tagging
   the argument is, and the untagging of a twin the twin. It is the
   two rewrites where both tests pass ([twin_ok], and
   FlambdaUntagParamsSpec.untag_ok on the term with the twins), and
   the term as it is otherwise: no twin stays that is not untagged.
   The result refines the term ([twin_untag_at_refines_statement]),
   whatever the positions: by the statement above and
   FlambdaUntagParamsSpec.untag_at_refines_statement.

   The positions that the pass is run with ([twin_positions]): the
   parameters of kind [Value] of the handlers that are not exception
   handlers, outside code, that the [Let]s at the head of their
   handler bind again ([twin_candidates]), less those that the test
   of the rewrite refuses ([twin_blame]), and less those whose twin
   FlambdaUntagParamsSpec.blame refuses in the term with the twins
   ([twin_origin] gives the position of a twin), until none is
   refused ([twin_settle]). Nothing is claimed of what is left.
   Where no handler has such a [Let] the pass gives the term back.

   What it is not: it does not decide as Simplify decides (the header
   of FlambdaUntagParamsSpec.v says how the two differ); and it gives
   a twin only what that file's rewrite can untag: a tagged constant,
   a parameter that has a twin, or a variable that a [Let] in scope
   binds to the tagging of a variable. Nothing is said here of which
   pairs of terms a validation that applies the pass accepts.

   Renaming: the functions here compare names by equality only and
   make none; the name of a twin is the parameter's own, and the name
   that takes its place is that of a [Let] of the term.
   FlambdaTwinParamsNamesProofs.v has the lemmas that the pass
   commutes with renaming and keeps scope; the statements are in
   FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceSpec.v and FlambdaStaticsScopeSpec.v.

   The proofs are in FlambdaTwinParamsProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
