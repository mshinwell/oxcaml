(* The rewrites and the checks that the validator is made of commute
   with renaming.

   This file is to be reviewed: [rewrite_equivariant], the action of a
   renaming on what a pass carries (the definitions named [rename_...]),
   and the statements.

   FlambdaEquivarianceSpec.v says that execution commutes with the
   renamings of FlambdaNominalSpec.v, and that two of the rewrites that
   the validation applies do ([fold_constants], [inline_calls]). Here are
   the statements for the other rewrites and for the checks of the files
   listed below, in the forms that a function on terms owes (NAMES.md,
   section 7):
   - a rewrite that takes a term and nothing else gives, on the renamed
     term, the renamed result ([rewrite_equivariant]);
   - a rewrite that takes names too, or something that holds names (the
     variables in scope, the code known, what a pass knows of the
     variables of the term), gives the renamed result when those are
     renamed with the term;
   - a check answers the same on the renamed term, the names it is given
     being renamed with it.
   Symbols, code ids and slots are not renamed. A map keyed by them
   keeps its keys; what it holds is renamed where it holds variables or
   continuations (the code known, under its code id; what is known of a
   symbol that is a block), and is as it was where it holds none (the
   names to remove, the code id of a symbol known to be a closure).

   The normalisation that the validation applies to the term after
   (FlambdaValidateSpec.normalise_after), the removal of static
   bindings ([without_statics]) and what a round of the term before
   does once the calls are inlined and the binders have names of their
   own ([normalise_before_inlined]) are made of these rewrites and
   commute with renaming too. The comparison of the two results
   answers the same when both are renamed
   (FlambdaCompareAlphaSpec.expr_eqb_equivariant_statement).

   The verdict does not depend on the names of the unit, where the
   code of the term before is closed. This file stated it of every
   pair of terms, while no rewrite of the validation made a name: the
   normalisation of the term before
   (FlambdaValidateSpec.normalise_before) commuted with renaming, and
   the check as a whole, FlambdaValidateSpec.validate_unit, answered
   the same on a pair of terms and on the pair renamed. A round of the
   term before now gives every binder a name of its own
   (FlambdaRenameApartSpec.rename_apart), and that rewrite makes
   names: it commutes with a renaming only up to the names that it
   makes. So the first statement is no longer here, and the second is
   of fewer terms. The last section says that the normalisation of the
   term before commutes with renaming up to the names that it makes,
   and that the check answers the same on a pair of terms and on the
   pair renamed where the code of the term before is closed, as that
   of a well-formed unit is ([validate_unit_equivariant_statement]).
   Nothing is said of a term before with open code.

   Each rewrite and each check of the sections before the one headed
   "Rewrites that make names" depends on the names of the term by
   their equality only: none goes by the order or the number of a
   name, and none makes a name. The one place where names are made
   from others is the renaming that inlining builds from the four
   continuations of a call and of the code called
   (FlambdaNormaliseSpec.inline_renaming); it is made of swaps of those
   four, and commutes with a renaming of them.

   Every statement of those sections is an equation and holds of every
   term: nothing is asked of the term, its code, its binders or its
   scopes. Four statements have a premise, on an argument that is a
   function: those of [rewrite_code], of [rewrite_rec_handlers] and of
   [iterate] ask that the rewrite they are given commutes with
   renaming, and that of [static_names] asks that the way it is given
   of reading the names of a binding does not look at variables and
   continuations. The statements of the two sections after them,
   "Rewrites that make names" and the last, are not all equations, and
   are of terms whose code is closed (FlambdaBindersSpec.code_closed),
   as that of a well-formed unit is.

   Kinds, arities and the metadata of handlers and of code have no
   names in them: a renaming keeps them, and a check that reads them
   answers the same.

   The rewrites and checks of FlambdaNormaliseSpec.v:
   - the checks [expr_in_scope], [inlinable_b], [tupled_inlinable_b]
     and [var_free_b], and the test of whether a call agrees with the
     code called in its arities ([call_agrees_b]);
   - the rewrites [remove_unused_lets], [inline_tail_conts] (with
     [inline_cont_at_tail], which it is made of), [drop_deleted_code],
     [remove_unused_total_lets], [remove_unused_defined_lets],
     [inline_known_calls], [merge_statics], [collapse_switches] and
     [thread_switches];
   - [rewrite_code], which takes a rewrite into the bodies of code: it
     is equivariant when the rewrite it is given is.

   Those of FlambdaUnusedContsSpec.v: the check [cont_free_b] and the
   rewrite [remove_unused_conts].

   Those of FlambdaUnusedStaticsSpec.v, where the names given are
   symbols and code ids: the checks [expr_avoids] and
   [binds_only_kept], the rewrite [erase_expr], and [drop_statics],
   which is the two together; and the condition on the environments
   under which that rewrite is sound ([envs_free_of]).

   Two passes go through a term carrying what they know of its names:
   FlambdaBlockLoadSpec.load_known_blocks, of the variables and symbols
   that are blocks, and FlambdaUnboxSpec.unbox_known_numbers, of those
   that are boxed or tagged numbers. What they carry holds variables,
   so a renaming acts on it ([rename_known_blocks],
   [rename_known_numbers], which are to be reviewed), and each pass
   commutes with renaming when what it knows is renamed with the term.
   As the validation runs them, with nothing known, they are rewrites
   that take a term and nothing else. A third pass is of the same
   kind: FlambdaAliasesSpec.follow_aliases, of the types library, which
   carries a typing environment of the first model of the types
   ([rename_naive_typing_env]).

   The checks of FlambdaWellFormedSpec.v, which say what a well-formed
   unit is: where static bindings may be ([statics_at_toplevel], with
   [raises_to], [handler_at_toplevel] and that file's
   [free_continuations]), the static names bound ([static_names]), the
   sets of closures ([sets_well_formed]), the numbers
   ([numbers_in_range]), the exception handlers
   ([unit_exn_handlers_well_formed], with [exn_handlers_well_formed],
   [ways_out_well_formed] and the three tests of how a term uses a
   continuation), the trap actions ([traps_well_formed], with
   [trap_demands], which carries the stack of the handlers installed
   and answers demands on continuations: a renaming acts on the two,
   [rename_trap_stack] and [rename_demands], which are to be
   reviewed), and the check itself ([well_formed_unit]),
   given the two continuations of the unit, which are renamed with it
   ([rename_unit_interface]); and the test of the states that the
   machine makes undefined ([static_fault]). The three conditions of
   [well_formed_unit] on binders are those of FlambdaBindersSpec.v,
   which FlambdaAlphaSpec.v says are unchanged by a renaming.

   The check of kinds of FlambdaWellKindedSpec.v, which the test tool
   runs on a unit before and after Simplify: the kind that is found
   for a [Simple] and for a defining expression, the checks of a
   static constant, of an application of a continuation and of a call,
   the check of a term ([well_kinded]) and that of a unit
   ([well_kinded_unit]). The check is given the kinds of the variables
   and the kinds of the parameters of the continuations in scope,
   which hold names, so a renaming acts on them ([rename_kind_env],
   [rename_arity_env], which are to be reviewed).

   The passes for loops, which the normalisations apply:
   FlambdaRecHandlersSpec.rewrite_rec_handlers, which takes a rewrite
   into the handlers of recursive continuations and commutes when the
   rewrite does; FlambdaSinkContsSpec.sink_let_conts;
   FlambdaShortcutSpec.shortcut_switches;
   FlambdaSameHandlersSpec.share_handlers;
   FlambdaUnusedParamsSpec.drop_unused_params;
   FlambdaDeadParamsSpec.drop_dead_params;
   FlambdaLoopAliasesSpec.follow_aliases_in_loops, which carries a
   typing environment as [follow_aliases] does;
   FlambdaLoopLetsSpec.remove_unused_defined_lets_in_loops, which
   carries the kinds of what is in scope as
   [remove_unused_defined_lets] does;
   FlambdaCodeLetsSpec.remove_unused_defined_lets_in_code, which
   starts that pass in the body of each piece of code;
   FlambdaParamAliasesSpec.bind_aliased_params;
   FlambdaForwardSpec.forward_applications, and the same with the
   calls taken on or not ([forward_applications_with]);
   FlambdaForwardJumpsSpec.forward_jumps;
   FlambdaInlineTailSpec.inline_tail_conts_kinded and
   FlambdaForwardKindedSpec.forward_kinded with
   [forward_kinded_in_code], which starts it in the body of each
   piece of code, which the validation applies to the term after; and
   FlambdaUnaliasParamsSpec.unalias_params, which takes away a
   parameter that every application gives one variable, and which the
   check applies to each term once its continuations are placed, and
   FlambdaGiveScrutineeSpec.give_scrutinees, which the check applies
   just before it and which gives such a parameter the scrutinee of a
   [Switch] where every application gives it the number of its arm;
   and FlambdaArmNumbersSpec.numbers_in_arms, which the check applies
   just after it and which puts the number of an arm for the
   scrutinee of its [Switch], and the tagged number for the variable
   that the scrutinee is the untagging of, where the arm reads them;
   and
   FlambdaWrapReturnsSpec.wrap_returns, which takes away a parameter
   that its handler does not use, of a continuation that a call
   returns to, the call returning to a wrapper, and which ends a
   round for an expression of the term before; and
   FlambdaUntagParamsSpec.untag_params, which untags, for a set of
   positions at once, the parameters of continuations that are only
   untagged or passed on, and which a round of the first phase of the
   term before applies after the unboxing. And
   FlambdaLoopifySpec.loopify_unit, which the validation applies to
   the term before, after the first comparison and before any rewrite
   that makes names: it is given, for the code ids to make loops of,
   the continuation of each loop, and a renaming acts on those
   continuations ([rename_loopified], which is to be reviewed).

   The normalisations of FlambdaValidateSpec.v: [iterate] of a rewrite
   that commutes, the three rounds of the first phase of the term
   before ([normalise_expr_params], [normalise_code_params],
   [normalise_params_round]), [normalise_before_inlined],
   [normalise_after], [without_statics], [demote_and_tidy], and, of
   those that the check applies to the term after,
   [without_head_statics] and [with_code_first]. And the calls of the
   term before taken on when its rounds are over, or the term as it
   is ([with_returns]), with the test by which the check chooses
   ([keeps_a_return]): taken or not, the rewrite commutes with
   renaming and keeps scope, and the test answers the same of a term
   renamed (the last section). And [placed], which the check
   applies once to each term that it compares after the first
   comparison, which is of the two terms as they are given: it is
   FlambdaSinkUsesSpec.sink_conts_to_uses in the term, in the handlers
   of its recursive continuations and in the bodies of its code; it
   commutes with renaming, and it keeps scope
   ([placed_keeps_scope_statement], in the last section). And what
   the check makes of each of those terms: its continuations placed,
   then rounds of [give_scrutinees], of [unalias_params], of
   [numbers_in_arms], for the term before of
   FlambdaMergeSwitchesSpec.merge_switches, of
   FlambdaCseSpec.share_known_primitives, of following aliases and of
   removing the [Let]s left unused, and then
   FlambdaGroupsUpSpec.groups_up ([tidied_before], [tidied_after]);
   both commute with renaming, and that of the term before keeps
   scope ([tidied_before_keeps_scope_statement], in the last
   section). The check,
   [validate_unit], is in the last section. It is given the liftings
   to make
   (FlambdaLiftSpec.lifting), each of which holds the two
   continuations of the unit, so a renaming acts on it
   ([rename_lifting], which is to be reviewed); the lifting, the
   removal of unused value slots, the folding on known symbols, the
   use of the static closures in sight and the moving up of the
   bindings of code commute with renaming by the statements of
   FlambdaLiftSpec.v, of FlambdaMyClosureSpec.v, of
   FlambdaUnusedSlotsSpec.v, of FlambdaKnownSymbolsSpec.v, of
   FlambdaKnownClosuresSpec.v and of FlambdaFloatCodeSpec.v. What
   the check makes of the first three ([with_lifting],
   [without_slots], [with_known]: the rewrites where their tests
   pass, the term as it is where they do not) is stated in the
   section of the check, and beside the first the same of
   FlambdaLiftObservedSpec.with_lifting_observed, which leaves out
   the test of the exits and which the check does not apply. Other
   rewrites that the check applies are stated to commute with
   renaming in their own files:
   FlambdaDemoteSpec.demote_handlers, of the end of the normalisation
   of the term before and of the liftings made in turn,
   FlambdaCseSpec.share_known_primitives,
   FlambdaRecoverComparisonSpec.recover_known_comparisons,
   FlambdaSameComparisonSpec.fold_same_comparisons,
   FlambdaShareProjectionsSpec.share_known_projections,
   FlambdaIdentitiesSpec.apply_identities,
   FlambdaMergeSwitchesSpec.merge_switches and
   FlambdaInlineSiblingsSpec.inline_sibling_calls, of a round of the
   term before, FlambdaMergeTablesSpec.merge_tables, which a round of
   the first phase of the term before applies first,
   FlambdaUnboxVariantsSpec.unbox_variants_knowing,
   FlambdaUnboxLoopsSpec.unbox_loops_knowing and
   FlambdaUnboxTogetherSpec.unbox_together_knowing, of
   the first phase of the term before, which are given what the static
   bindings in scope make known of their symbols, in code and in
   loops (FlambdaUnboxVariantsRenameSpec.v; what is known of symbols
   alone is not changed by a renaming, and the two functions that
   take it into code and into loops commute with renaming where the
   rewrite that they are given does: FlambdaUnboxInScopeRenameSpec.v),
   and FlambdaStaticsOrderSpec.order_statics_as, which
   the check applies to the term before with the term after as its
   pattern. One of a round of the term after is stated here:
   FlambdaUnusedProjectionsSpec.remove_unused_projections, which
   carries what it knows of the variables that are sets of closures;
   the action of a renaming on that is in its file
   ([rename_known_sets]). The rewrites from the types, which the
   normalisation of the term before applies once, between the rounds
   of its second phase and those rounds once more, commute with
   renaming by the statement of the types library
   (FlambdaSimplifyPassRenamingSpec.simplify_by_types_equivariant_statement);
   the function that the normalisation calls for them is equal to the
   one of that statement
   (FlambdaSimplifyCarriedSpec.simplify_by_types_carried_eq_statement);
   they are applied under a test that what they give keeps scope
   (FlambdaGuardScopeSpec.guard_scope), which keeps scope whatever
   the rewrite is and commutes with renaming where the rewrite does
   (FlambdaValidateScopeSpec.v). The code whose calls the check is
   told not to inline is named by code ids, which no renaming changes.

   Rewrites that make names. A rewrite that makes names with
   FlambdaNameAbstractionSpec.fresh_name, outside the names of the term
   it is given, does not commute with a renaming: which name is made
   depends on the numbers of the names of the term, and a renaming
   changes those. The section of that name says what such a rewrite
   can do instead, which is to commute up to the names that it makes
   ([equivariant_up_to]); that this composes with the rewrites above,
   for rewrites that keep scope ([keeps_scope]); and that the
   comparison of FlambdaCompareSpec.v, which is up to bound names,
   answers the same ([expr_eqb_up_to_statement]). The three
   definitions are to be reviewed. They speak of the free names by the
   one function for each sort of FlambdaBindersSpec.v, which goes into
   code.

   The validation applies one such rewrite,
   FlambdaRenameApartSpec.rename_apart_avoiding, which is given
   continuations that the names it makes are to avoid; [rename_apart]
   is that rewrite given none. After a lifting it is given the
   continuations of the units of the liftings
   (FlambdaValidateSpec.unit_continuations): a lifting reads those of
   its unit, and the term that it is applied to need not mention them,
   so a binder that was given one of them as its name could change
   what the next lifting does. Of a rewrite that is given
   continuations to avoid, commuting up to the names that it makes
   says one thing more ([equivariant_up_to_avoiding]): the
   continuations are renamed with the term, and the second renaming
   does to them what the first does ([rename_conts_alike]). Those two
   definitions are to be reviewed too.

   The section after it, the last, says what follows for the
   validation: a round of the term before, [normalise_before], and the
   normalisation of a term in which something was lifted
   ([normalise_lifted]) keep scope and commute with renaming up to the
   names that they make, the last with the continuations that it is
   given to avoid; so do the liftings made in turn, each followed by
   that normalisation ([lifted_in_turn]), where the continuations to
   avoid have those of the units of the liftings among them; the
   putting first of the static bindings ([with_statics_first]), which
   reads the continuations of the unit of a lifting, commutes with a
   renaming of the term where the liftings are under another that
   does to those continuations what it does; and [validate_unit]
   answers the same on a pair of
   terms and on the pair renamed, where the code of the term before is
   closed, and more generally where the term before is under a second
   renaming that does to its free names, and to the continuations
   that the validation is given, what the first does
   ([validate_unit_renamed_alike_statement]). They rest on what the
   file of [rename_apart] states and
   proves, that [rename_apart_avoiding] commutes with renaming up to
   the names that it makes, the second renaming doing to the
   continuations to avoid what the first does
   (FlambdaRenameApartSpec.rename_apart_avoiding_equivariant_up_to_statement),
   and on the statements that each rewrite of the validation keeps
   scope: FlambdaKeepsScopeSpec.v and FlambdaValidateScopeSpec.v for
   those of a round, and FlambdaStaticsScopeSpec.v for those that the
   check applies to the term before besides.

   Nothing is trusted here. The proofs are in
   FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceProofs.v, which needs no review. *)

   by the two continuations of the unit of the first lifting, and the
   check applies it to the term before with the liftings made, which
   is under a renaming of its own by then. So it is stated with the
   liftings under one renaming and the term under another, which does
   to the continuations of the units of the liftings what the first
   does. With one renaming for the two it is an equation with no
   premise. That it keeps scope is in FlambdaStaticsScopeSpec.v. *)
Definition with_statics_first_renamed_alike_statement : Prop :=
  ∀ (r r' : renaming) (Ls : list lifting) (e : expr),
    rename_conts_alike r r' (unit_continuations Ls) ->
    with_statics_first (map (rename_lifting r) Ls) (rename_expr r' e)
    = rename_expr r' (with_statics_first Ls e).

(* The validation answers the same, and for the same reason, on two
   terms and on the two renamed by one renaming, the liftings being
   renamed with them, where the code of the term before is closed. The
   number of rounds, the names of the static bindings to remove, the
   value slots to remove and the code whose calls are not inlined are
   as they were. Nothing is asked of the term after: its normalisation
   commutes with renaming, and so do the removal of unused static
   bindings from its head and the putting of its code first
   ([without_head_statics_equivariant_statement],
   [with_code_first_equivariant_statement]).

   The first comparison is of the two terms as they are, and answers
   the same of the two renamed. After it the direct calls of the code
   of the stubs of the term before are made indirect
   (FlambdaStubCallsSpec.demote_stub_calls), which commutes with the
   renaming, as that renames no code id and keeps what code is
   annotated with, and keeps the code closed; the direct calls of
   code that never returns are put under a binding of their return
   continuation to a handler that is [Invalid]
   (FlambdaNeverReturnsSpec.cut_returns), which commutes with the
   renaming exactly, as it makes no name, and keeps the code closed
   (FlambdaNeverReturnsScopeSpec.v); and the self tail calls
   of the code named are made jumps (FlambdaLoopifySpec.loopify_unit),
   which commutes with the renaming, the names given for the loops
   being renamed with the term ([rename_loopified]), and keeps the
   code closed; what follows is said of the term that this gives. The
   next three are of the term before normalised, which under the
   renaming is that term under a second renaming that does to its
   free names what the first does; for the third of them, and for the
   two comparisons after it, the term after has the unused static
   bindings of its head removed
   (FlambdaValidateSpec.without_head_statics). The last
   two are of the term before with the liftings made in turn, each
   followed by a normalisation
   ([lifted_in_turn_equivariant_up_to_statement]). The first lifting
   commutes with the renaming;
   the normalisation after it makes names, so the term that the next
   lifting is applied to is, under the renaming, that term under
   another renaming, which does to its free names what the first does.
   A lifting holds the two continuations of its unit, and it is given
   renamed by the first renaming. Each normalisation is given the
   continuations of the units of all the liftings to avoid
   (FlambdaValidateSpec.unit_continuations), so the other renaming
   does to them what the first does, and the lifting renamed by the
   first is the lifting renamed by the other, whether or not the term
   still mentions those continuations.
   Each of those terms, and the term after normalised, then has its
   continuations placed and is tidied
   (FlambdaValidateSpec.tidied_before, [tidied_after]), which commutes
   with every renaming and, for the term before, keeps scope
   ([tidied_before_equivariant_statement],
   [tidied_after_equivariant_statement],
   [tidied_before_keeps_scope_statement]).
   The removal of static bindings, the removal of value slots, the
   moving up of the bindings of code, the putting first of the static
   bindings ([with_statics_first_renamed_alike_statement]) and the
   ordering of static bindings commute with those renamings and keep
   scope (FlambdaStaticsScopeSpec.v); and the comparison is up to bound
   names and does not tell apart two renamings that rename the free
   names of its first term alike ([expr_eqb_renamed_alike_statement]).

   What is not said. Nothing is said of a term before with open code.
   Before a round renamed binders apart this statement had no premise.
   While the round after a lifting was not told the continuations of
   the units, the statement had a second premise, on the terms that
   the liftings after the first are applied to; it has no such second
   premise now. *)
Definition validate_unit_equivariant_statement : Prop :=
  ∀ (r : renaming) (rounds : nat) (unused : dropped)
    (slots : list value_slot) (G : loopified) (Ls : list lifting)

    validate_unit rounds unused slots (rename_loopified r G)
      (map (rename_lifting r) Ls) kept (rename_expr r before)
      (rename_expr r after)
    = validate_unit rounds unused slots G Ls kept before after.

(* The same where the term before is under a second renaming, which
   does to its free names what the first does, and does so to the
   continuations that the validation is given and the term need not
   mention: those of the units of the liftings and those given for the
   loops. The statement above is the case in which the two renamings
   are one.

   This is the form for a caller that has rewritten the term before,
   ahead of the validation, with a rewrite that makes names: of the
   renamed term such a rewrite gives its result under a second
   renaming. The premise about those continuations is why such a
   rewrite is to be given them to avoid
   ([equivariant_up_to_avoiding]): what
   the second renaming does to the free names of the term says nothing
   of a continuation that the term does not mention, and the
   validation reads these, the lifting for the continuations of its
   unit and FlambdaLoopifySpec.loopify_unit for the continuation of
   each loop. *)
