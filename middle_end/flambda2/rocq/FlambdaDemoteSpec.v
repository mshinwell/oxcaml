(* The demotion of an exception handler: a handler that no call can
   raise to is made an ordinary continuation, and the trap actions that
   name it are removed.

   This file is to be reviewed: [called_with_exn], [binds_continuation],
   [demotable], [strip_traps], [clear_exn_handler] and
   [demote_handlers], against what Simplify does
   (simplify/simplify_let_cont_expr.ml, where a handler whose uses do
   not escape is recorded by [DA.demote_exn_handler] and rebuilt as an
   ordinary one; simplify/simplify_common.ml: [apply_cont_use_kind],
   which says which uses escape, and [clear_demoted_trap_action], which
   removes the trap actions); and the statements.

   Where Simplify sees every raise that reaches a handler, the handler
   need not be installed: a raise to it can be a jump. Simplify does
   this for every [try] of the source whose body it can read to the
   end. The exception continuation of a call is a use that escapes: the
   callee finds the handler on the stack. So the handler of a [try]
   with a call in its body, outside any inner [try], stays.

   [demote_handlers] is that rewrite, done wherever it applies. At a
   non-recursive [Let_cont] of [k] whose handler says it is an
   exception handler, if no call in the body has [k] as its exception
   continuation ([demotable]), the handler loses its mark and every
   trap action of the body that names [k] is removed: the [Push] that
   installed it, the [Pop] on the way out of the [try], and the [Pop]
   of each raise to it, which becomes an ordinary application of [k].
   It goes into handlers and into code.

   The rewrite, like the checks of exception handlers, goes by names
   and does not follow rebinding. So it leaves alone a handler whose
   name is bound again in the body, or is that of a continuation in
   whose scope the [Let_cont] stands: the function takes the names in
   scope ([scope]), which for a unit are its return and exception
   continuations, and for code those of the code. The compiler's terms
   bind each name once, and lose nothing by this.

   What it does not look at, where Simplify does:
   - the kind of a raise. Simplify takes a [Pop] of a raise that keeps a
     backtrace ([Regular] or [Reraise]) for a use that escapes when
     the unit is compiled with debugging information, and so keeps the
     handler; the machines observe no backtrace, and the rewrite does
     not look (discrepancy C5-4). On a unit compiled so the rewrite
     demotes where Simplify did not, which can leave the two terms
     different in structure. Nothing is claimed here of backtraces, or
     of the native code of a handler that is demoted;
   - the argument of a raise. Where nothing reads the exception,
     Simplify replaces it ([patch_unused_exn_bucket]); that is another
     rewrite.

   The statements.
   - [demote_handlers_equivalent_statement]: the term and the result
     behave alike under all environments. This is about the machine of
     FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v, which executes no trap action and does not
     read the mark of a handler: on that machine any change of trap
     actions and of marks is an equivalence, and the condition
     ([demotable]) plays no part.
   - The condition is what the next three need. A unit that passes the
     two checks of exception handlers
     (FlambdaWellFormedSpec.unit_exn_handlers_well_formed and
     traps_well_formed) still passes them after the rewrite
     ([demote_handlers_keeps_exn_handlers_statement],
     [demote_handlers_keeps_traps_statement]); and so, on the machine
     with a stack of handlers (FlambdaTrapSpec.v), a unit that follows
     the discipline of trap actions behaves after the rewrite as before
     ([demote_handlers_stack_statement]). Without the condition the
     last is false: a handler demoted under a call no longer catches
     what the callee raises ([demotion_under_call_statement]).
   - The rewrite keeps the binders of a term
     ([demote_handlers_binders_statement]), and commutes with renaming
     ([demote_handlers_equivariant_statement]).
   That it keeps scope, in the sense that the validator asks of a
   rewrite it applies, is stated in FlambdaDemoteScopeSpec.v. The
   statement about the stack is from the empty static environment, as
   FlambdaTrapSpec.stack_agrees_statement is.

   Why the condition is enough, in terms of the check of trap actions.
   Under the discipline a call names the handler installed last. So
   "no call in the scope of [k] names [k]" says that no call is made
   while [k] is on top of the stack. Remove [k] from the stack
   everywhere: a call still has its own handler on top; a [Pop] of
   another handler still finds it on top; a raise to [k] found [k] on
   top and what was below it is the stack at the [Push], which is the
   stack that the jump now arrives with.

   The model has no exception that is not raised by a raise or a call
   of the term. The compiler has some: stdlib/sys.mli documents that an
   asynchronous [Break] or [Stack_overflow] (from a signal handler, a
   finaliser or the collector) is raised from the call site of
   [Sys.with_async_exns], and without one goes to the toplevel handler
   of uncaught exceptions. A [try] around that call may catch it; but
   then its body has a call whose exception continuation is its
   handler, and the rewrite leaves it alone. So, of those two
   exceptions, the handler of a [try] whose body has no call is
   reached by the raises of the body alone, as the rewrite takes it.
   Any other event of the runtime is outside the model.

   Two examples: the [try] that the front end makes around a raise,
   which the rewrite makes into what Simplify leaves
   ([demote_handlers_try_raise_statement]); and the one above, of a
   [try] around a call.

   The proofs are in FlambdaDemoteProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
