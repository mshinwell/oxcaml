(* The unboxing of continuation parameters commutes with renaming, and
   keeps scope.

   This file is to be reviewed: [rename_facts] and the statements.

   FlambdaUnboxParamsSpec.unbox_known_params goes through a term
   carrying what is known of its variables (the blocks and the wrapped
   numbers of FlambdaBlockLoadSpec.v and FlambdaUnboxSpec.v), compares
   names by equality only, and binds no name that the term has not got:
   the variable that becomes a parameter was bound by the [Let] that
   goes. So it commutes with the renamings of FlambdaNominalSpec.v, in
   the forms of FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceSpec.v, which this file
   follows:
   - what a primitive that reads a box is known to give of an argument
     ([projection_of]) is renamed when what is known and the argument
     are;
   - an expression with its applications extended
     ([extend_applications]) is renamed when what is known, the
     continuation and the expression are, and the one fails where the
     other does;
   - the pass given what is known ([unbox_params_knowing]) gives the
     renamed result when what is known is renamed with the term;
   - the pass as the validation would run it, with nothing known, is a
     rewrite that takes a term and nothing else
     ([unbox_known_params_equivariant_statement], which is
     [rewrite_equivariant unbox_known_params]).
   The position of a parameter and the primitive are not names and are
   as they were.

   Each of these statements is an equation and holds of every term.

   The pass also keeps scope
   (FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceSpec.keeps_scope): on a term whose code
   is closed, the code of the result is closed and every variable or
   continuation that is free in the result is free in the term. What an
   application is given is a constant, or what a [Let] or a static
   binding in scope was given, and that is forgotten under a binder of
   it; and the variable that becomes a parameter was bound in the
   handler by the [Let] that goes.

   The proofs are in FlambdaUnboxParamsRenameProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
