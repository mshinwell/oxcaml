(* Simulations by rounds: one or more steps of the first state are
   answered by one or more steps of the second. Nothing here needs
   review: it is a way of proving [refines], beside
   FlambdaSemanticsProofs.simulation_refines, which asks that the two
   states step together, and FlambdaSimulationProofs.stuttering_refines,
   in which one step of the first is answered by one or more of the
   second.

   It serves where a rewrite makes several steps into one: an
   application of a continuation whose handler only applies another,
   made an application of that other (FlambdaForwardProofs.v). Each
   round uses up at least one step of each run, so a run of the first
   that exits is followed round by round to its exit, and a run of the
   second that has ended bounds the rounds of the first
   ([rounds_ends]); no measure is needed, and divergence never has to be
   considered. *)

Section Rounds.

Variable R : state -> state -> Prop.

(* What some steps of the first state come to is answered by the second
   state: nothing is asked if the first run is undefined; an exit is
   answered by an exit through the same continuation with the same
   values; a state, by one or more steps to a related state. *)
Definition round_answered (result : step_result) (s' : state) : Prop :=
  match result with
  | Undefined => True
  | Exit k vs hp => ∃ m : nat, run m s' = Exit k vs hp
  | Step t => ∃ (m : nat) (t' : state), run (S m) s' = Step t' ∧ R t t'
  end.

(* Two states that step together make a round of one step each. *)
Lemma step_round (s s' : state) :
