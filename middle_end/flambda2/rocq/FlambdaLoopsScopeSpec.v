(* The rewrites of the validation for loops keep scope.

   This file is to be reviewed: the statements.

   FlambdaKeepsScopeSpec.v says what it is for a rewrite to keep scope
   (FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceSpec.keeps_scope), why it matters, and
   that the rewrites of a round do. This file says the same of the
   rewrites that were written for loops, one statement to a rewrite:
   those that a round applies as they are
   (FlambdaSinkContsSpec.sink_let_conts,
   FlambdaShortcutSpec.shortcut_switches,
   FlambdaUnusedParamsSpec.drop_unused_params,
   FlambdaDeadParamsSpec.drop_dead_params,
   FlambdaParamAliasesSpec.bind_aliased_params,
   FlambdaForwardSpec.forward_applications); the removal of the unused
   [Let]s that have a value, in loops too
   (FlambdaLoopLetsSpec.remove_unused_defined_lets_in_loops), whatever
   is taken to be in scope; the following of
   aliases into the handlers of recursive continuations
   (FlambdaLoopAliasesSpec.follow_aliases_in_loops), with nothing known
   to begin with, as a round applies it; a rewrite that keeps scope,
   taken into the handlers of the recursive continuations
   (FlambdaRecHandlersSpec.rewrite_rec_handlers); the moving of a
   continuation down past the bindings under it
   (FlambdaSinkUsesSpec.sink_conts_to_uses), which the validation
   applies once, when the rounds are over, to each term that it then
   compares; and loopify (FlambdaLoopifySpec.loopify_unit), which
   the validation applies to the term before after its first
   comparison fails, for the code and the names of loops that it is
   given.

   Closed code is all that is asked of a term, as [keeps_scope] asks
   it. Loopify binds a name that its caller gives: the code it makes is
   closed whatever that name is, since the loop binds it. Two of the
   rewrites put a variable where it was not: [bind_aliased_params]
   binds a parameter, at the start of its handler, to what every
   application gives it, and [forward_applications] gives an
   application the arguments of the handler it goes to. Each keeps
   scope because the variable was free already: in the body of the
   [Let_cont], as an argument of an application there, or in the
   handler.

   Nothing is trusted here. The proofs are in
   FlambdaLoopsScopeProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
