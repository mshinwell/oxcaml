(* A [Switch] whose arms all apply one continuation, to arguments that
   are computed from the number of the arm: a normalisation that
   refines.

   This file is to be reviewed: [merge_switches] and what it is made
   of, and the statements. The rewrite is one of the normalisations
   of the term before Simplify that the validation of
   middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/ applies: in a round of each of
   its two phases it follows [collapse_switches]
   (FlambdaValidateSpec.normalise_expr_before and
   [normalise_expr_params]). It is extracted and run with them.

   What Simplify does. Where the arms of a [Switch] all apply the same
   continuation with no trap action, and each argument is either the
   same in every arm or a constant that is computed from the number of
   the arm, Simplify makes of the [Switch] one application of the
   continuation, under the [Let]s of the primitives that compute those
   arguments from the scrutinee ([rebuild_switch] of
   middle_end/flambda2/simplify/simplify_switch_expr.ml). So
   [switch i with 0 -> k x 0t | 1 -> k x 1t], where [0t] is the tagged
   immediate, becomes [let tagged = Tag_immediate i in k x tagged].
   The model of that function, with what it is given and what is
   stated of it, is ../types/rocq/FlambdaSimplifySwitchMergeSpec.v.

   [merge_switches] does as much to the term before, for four of the
   ways in which Simplify computes an argument:
   - the argument is, in every arm, the number of the arm as a tagged
     immediate: the scrutinee is tagged ([By_tagging]);
   - the argument is the tagged immediate 1 in the arm of 0 and the
     tagged immediate 0 in the arm of 1, and there is no other arm:
     the scrutinee is tagged and the result negated
     ([By_tagging_and_negating]);
   - the argument is, in every arm, the number of the arm as a naked
     immediate: it is the scrutinee, and no primitive is needed
     ([As_it_is]). Simplify takes such an argument for one that is
     the same in every arm, the scrutinee, whatever the number of the
     arms ([recognize_mergeable_argument], where the function of the
     number of the arm is the identity on naked immediates);
   - the argument is, in every arm, an offset plus a slope times the
     number of the arm, as a tagged immediate or as a naked one, and
     there are three arms or more: the scrutinee, tagged first where
     the argument is tagged, is multiplied by the slope and added to
     the offset ([By_arithmetic]; [Affine_argument] and
     [enough_arms] of Simplify). The slope and the offset are those
     of the line through the first two arms.
   Simplify decides for each argument, so the arguments of one
   [Switch] may be computed in several of these ways, or by
   arithmetic with several slopes. Here there are two cases. Where
   the arguments that differ from arm to arm are all computed in the
   same one of the four ways, and for the fourth with one slope and
   one offset, the variable of the scrutinee is bound again and holds
   what is computed ([merge_switch]). Otherwise, where the
   continuation that the arms apply is bound by a [Let_cont] around
   the [Switch], a way is chosen for each argument, and each argument
   that is computed is bound to the parameter of that continuation at
   its position ([merge_switch_by_arguments]). The arms an argument
   of which Simplify loads from a table of the constants of the arms
   ([Lookup_table_argument]) are not merged.

   How it decides ([merge_switch]). The scrutinee must be a variable
   and there must be two arms or more. The application that the
   [Switch] may become applies the continuation of the first arm, with
   no trap action; its arguments are those of the first arm where the
   second arm has the same, and the variable of the scrutinee where it
   has not ([merged_arguments]), and the variable must be among them.
   Every arm must then be that application with a constant in place of
   the variable ([arm_is_merged]): the constant that is computed from
   the number of the arm ([constant_of_arm]). Where that is so of all
   the arms the [Switch] becomes the application: for the first way
   under a [Let] of the variable as itself tagged, for the second
   under a second [Let] of the variable as that negated
   ([bind_tagged], [bind_negated]), for the third with no [Let], and
   for the fourth under a [Let] for each primitive of the arithmetic
   ([bind_arithmetic]). Otherwise the [Switch] is left as it is.

   The arithmetic of the fourth way. The slope and the offset are
   computed from the first two arms as Simplify computes them
   ([arithmetic_of_arms], [line_through]); they say which primitives
   there are ([arithmetic_steps]): the multiplication by the slope,
   which is not made by 1, then the addition of the offset, which is
   not made of 0; for a negative slope the multiplication is by its
   opposite and the result is subtracted from the offset. The
   constant of an arm is then what those primitives compute of its
   number ([arithmetic_value]), which wraps as they do, and each arm,
   the first two with the others, is tested to have that constant. So
   the refinement does not depend on how the slope and the offset are
   found: a slope or an offset that is not that of the arms merges
   nothing.

   For the ways that apply a primitive, the variable of the scrutinee
   is bound again, once for each primitive, where Simplify binds a new
   variable each time; for the third nothing is bound. So the
   rewrite makes no name, and needs none to be given; the comparison
   of the validation is up to bound names (FlambdaCompareSpec.v).
   The arguments that are the same in every arm are not captured by
   the new [Let]s: in the merged arguments the variable of the
   scrutinee marks the arguments that are computed, so an argument
   that is that variable in the arms is read as one of them, and then
   no arm is the application with a constant in its place: nothing is
   merged. Nothing is assumed of the numbers of the arms: for the
   first way they are tested to be immediates
   ([in_range]), as [Tag_immediate] has no value on a number that is
   not one and the machine does not ask it of the scrutinee of a
   [Switch]; for the second they are 0 or 1; for the third nothing is
   asked of them, as the variable is passed with the value that the
   machine has for it; for the fourth they are tested to be
   immediates, as for the first, and the constants of the arithmetic
   too, as [Int_arith] has no value on a constant that is not an
   integer of its kind.

   The ways chosen for each argument ([merge_switch_knowing]). The
   rewrite carries, on its way down, the continuations that are bound
   around where it is, each with its parameters
   ([merge_switches_knowing], [known_continuations]): that of a
   non-recursive [Let_cont] in its body, those of a recursive one in
   its body. Where [merge_switch] leaves a [Switch] and the
   continuation of its first arm is one of those, a way is looked for
   for each argument, across the arms ([way_of_column]): the same in
   every arm, or else the first of the four ways that gives the
   argument of every arm, in the order in which [merge_switch] tries
   them, the arithmetic being that of the first two arms and for three
   arms or more. Every arm must then apply the continuation of the
   first, with no trap action, to the arguments that the ways give for
   its number ([arm_has_ways]); as for the slope and the offset, how
   the ways were found is not a premise of the refinement. The
   [Switch] becomes the application under the [Let]s of the ways, the
   first argument outermost ([bind_ways]). An argument that is
   computed is bound to the parameter of the continuation at its
   position, by the primitives of its way, the first of which reads
   the scrutinee and the others that parameter ([bind_way]); the
   scrutinee is not bound again. An argument that is the scrutinee as
   it is, is the scrutinee, with no [Let], and one that is the same in
   every arm stays. The parameters must be as many as the arguments,
   no two the same, none the scrutinee, and none may occur in an
   argument that is the same in every arm ([names_usable]): a
   parameter bound so hides a variable of the same name, and under
   the new [Let]s there is only the application. So the rewrite still
   makes no name. The refinement holds whatever the names are, under
   those tests; that they are read off the term is what makes the
   rewrite commute with renaming. Simplify computes once a primitive
   that two arguments share (the tagging of the scrutinee, the
   multiplication by one slope); here each argument has its own, and
   the sharing is left to the rewrite of the validation that shares
   primitives (FlambdaCseSpec.share_known_primitives). Where the
   continuation is not bound in sight (the return continuation of
   code, a continuation bound outside a handler that the rewrite is
   applied to on its own), only [merge_switch] applies.

   [merge_switches] goes where
   FlambdaNormaliseSpec.collapse_switches goes: into the bodies of
   [Let]s, of static bindings and of the bindings of continuations,
   and into the handlers of non-recursive continuations. It leaves
   the handlers of recursive continuations and the bodies of code as
   they are: a round of the validation takes it there as it takes
   the other rewrites of the round, with
   FlambdaRecHandlersSpec.rewrite_rec_handlers and
   FlambdaNormaliseSpec.rewrite_code, and there it starts with no
   continuation known. A [Switch] whose arms are all the same is left
   to [collapse_switches].

   The result refines the term ([merge_switches_refines_statement]).
   Where the scrutinee is the number of an arm, the [Switch] goes to
   that arm, and the merged term binds the variable to the constant
   of that arm, in a step for each of its [Let]s (for the third way
   the variable holds it already), and applies the continuation to
   the same values; with a way for each argument it binds each
   parameter to the constant that the arm has there. It is not an
   equivalence: the [Switch] is
   undefined where the scrutinee is not the number of an arm, and the
   merged term is not.

   The rewrite commutes with renaming
   ([merge_switches_equivariant_statement]): it makes no name, the
   names that it binds are the scrutinee or parameters of the term,
   and it looks at names only to compare them, which a renaming,
   being injective, keeps true or false. That it keeps scope, which is that
   on a term whose code is closed the code of the result is closed and
   every variable or continuation that is free in the result is free
   in the term, is stated with the same of the other rewrites of a
   round (FlambdaKeepsScopeSpec.merge_switches_keeps_scope_statement).

   Five terms as checks of the definitions
   ([merge_switches_tagging_example_statement],
   [merge_switches_negating_example_statement],
   [merge_switches_as_it_is_example_statement],
   [merge_switches_arithmetic_example_statement],
   [merge_switches_two_ways_example_statement]).

   The proofs are in FlambdaMergeSwitchesProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
