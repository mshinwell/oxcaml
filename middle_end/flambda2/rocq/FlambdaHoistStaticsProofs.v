(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaHoistStaticsSpec.v. Nothing here
   needs review.

   The unit and the unit with its closed static bindings first are run
   side by side, in step, with the same values: the second state is the
   first with those bindings taken out of its terms, all the code bound,
   and the symbols that were taken out bound beside those that the first
   state has bound and that were not ([hoist_state]). Three things are
   kept along the run of the first. No static name is bound twice (the
   invariant of FlambdaWellFormedProofs.v, for code ids and for
   symbols). What the terms of the state still bind is what the second
   state has bound, where it is taken out, and is not a name taken out
   otherwise ([known_inv]). And every static name that the state holds
   or mentions is bound (the invariant of FlambdaStaticsInScopeProofs.v):
   so whatever the first run looks up, the second finds bound to the
   same thing, and what the second has bound early is not looked at
   before the first binds it. *)
