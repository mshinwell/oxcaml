(* Renamings act on the states of the machine with a heap, and its
   execution is equivariant.

   This file is to be reviewed: the action ([rename_heap_state],
   [rename_outcome], [rename_heap_result], [rename_heap_behaviour]) and
   the statements.

   FlambdaHeapMachineSpec.v has a machine whose states are those of
   FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v with a heap. FlambdaEquivarianceSpec.v says
   that the renamings of variables and of continuations act on the
   states without a heap and that a step, a run and a behaviour commute
   with the action. Here is the same of the machine with a heap.

   What the action does to memory: nothing. A location is a name of a
   sort of its own (requests/C4-heap.md, sections 2.2 and 5): no
   renaming of variables or of continuations moves one. A value holds
   locations, symbols and code ids, and no variable and no continuation;
   a cell of the heap holds values, and so do the extra arguments that a
   continuation keeps. So the heap of a state is left as it is, and so
   are the values and the heap of an outcome. The code of the
   static environment is renamed, as in a state without a heap, and an
   outcome carries a static environment, so its code is renamed too;
   what is observed of an outcome is read from its values, its
   statically allocated values and its heap
   ([outcome_related_equivariant_statement]: renaming the code of two
   outcomes, by any two renamings, does not change whether they are
   related).

   Two runs are compared in FlambdaHeapMachineSpec.v up to a
   correspondence between their locations ([outcome_related]). That is
   another relation than the renaming of bound names, on another sort
   of thing, and the two do not meet: the statements here are
   equations, for one run and its renaming, with the same locations on
   both sides. The action of the permutations of locations is in
   FlambdaLocationsSpec.v, and what the primitives and a step of
   FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v do with it is in
   FlambdaLocationsPrimitiveSpec.v and FlambdaLocationsMachineSpec.v;
   nothing is said there of a step of the machine of this file.

   The statements:
   - the action is that of a group, and it commutes with forgetting the
     heap;
   - a step, a run and a behaviour commute with it, with no premise;
   - so refinement of states, and of expressions under closed memories,
     is preserved by renaming;
   - a state with a heap has a finite support, as one without has
     (FlambdaStateSupportSpec.v): with the action, the states of the
     machine with a heap are a nominal set, and the heap adds nothing to
     the support.

   Nothing is trusted here. The proofs are in
   FlambdaHeapEquivarianceProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
