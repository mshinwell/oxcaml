(* Lifting to a group of static bindings around: a [Let] of a closure,
   an immutable block or a boxed number, made an alias of a symbol that
   a group of static bindings around it binds to what the [Let] makes.

   This file is to be reviewed: [constant_known], [forget],
   [putable_group], [group_in_scope], [lift_around], [around_ok] and
   [groups_of], against what Simplify does (below);
   [lift_around_unit], which is extracted and run by the validation
   of middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/; and the statements.

   What Simplify does, in three cases that the other liftings of the
   validation do not cover.

   The arm of a test. A block or a closure made in the arm of a test
   that the module makes when it runs, with a field that is a variable
   bound before the test:

     let x = ... in
     let_cont k () = (let b = Make_block 0 (x) in cont k' (b)) in
     switch c | 0 -> cont k' (0) | 1 -> cont k ()

   An arm is not at toplevel (FlambdaWellFormedSpec.handler_at_toplevel),
   so no static binding may stand in it, and the block mentions a
   variable, so it cannot be bound at the head of the unit
   (FlambdaLiftFromArmsSpec.v). Simplify binds a symbol to the block
   before the test, where the variable is in scope, and the arm gives
   the symbol.

   A loop. A block or a closure made in a loop that the module runs,
   with a field or a value slot that is a variable bound before the
   loop: the handler of a recursive continuation is executed many
   times, so no static binding may stand in it, and the constant
   mentions a variable. Simplify binds a symbol to it before the loop.

   Equal constants. Where a [Let] makes a block, a boxed number or a
   closure equal to the constant that a symbol of the unit is bound to
   already, Simplify uses that symbol and binds no other: two blocks
   that hold the same constants are one symbol. Simplify does so for
   a constant that mentions no variable (reification.ml reuses a
   constant that [Static_const.can_share] accepts, which asks that it
   be fully static). The check here asks less: a [Let] may be made an
   alias of a symbol that is bound to the same constant with variables
   in it, if none of them is bound again in between ([forget]). That
   is more than the sharing of Simplify does, and a guess need not
   use it.

   What is here. [lift_around] makes the [Let]s at the paths given
   aliases of symbols, and puts the groups of static bindings given
   before the [Let_cont]s at the paths given, recursive or not:

     Let_cont k h body
       becomes
     Let_static bindings (Let_cont k h' body')

   where [h'] and [body'] are [h] and [body] with their [Let]s made
   aliases, and the same for the handlers of a group of recursive
   continuations (their paths are those of
   FlambdaLiftSpec.rec_handlers_map). Which [Let]s, to which symbols,
   is a guess of the caller's, and so is which groups are put where:
   the guess names, for a [Let_cont], the [Let]s whose bindings make
   the group put before it, by their paths, and the group is read off
   the unit ([groups_of]). So a guess names paths and symbols, and no
   variable: it is the same guess for the unit under any renaming.
   Nothing is believed of it: [around_ok] checks it. The check goes
   down the unit with the
   symbols that the groups around the place bind, each with its
   constant ([known_constants]): those of the groups of the unit that
   it has passed and of the groups put. Where a variable is bound, by
   a [Let] or as a parameter of a handler, it forgets the constants
   that mention the variable ([forget]): the variable may then have
   another value than when the group was bound. A [Let] may be made
   an alias of a symbol only if the bindings that
   FlambdaLiftSpec.lift_named gives for it, to that symbol, are among
   those known: the symbol is bound, by a group around the [Let], to
   the constant that the [Let] makes, and every variable of the
   constant has the value that it had at the group. A group may be put
   only if it binds symbols, to constants that have a value wherever
   their variables have ([putable_group]), and mentions only variables
   that the [Let_cont] it is put before mentions ([group_in_scope]):
   the unit lifted then has no variable free that the unit had not,
   whatever the unit. The handlers of recursive continuations are
   gone into for [Let]s to make aliases: what is known at the
   [Let_cont] is known in a handler less what mentions its
   parameters, at every round. No group may be put in such a
   handler: the machine does not run a loop whose handlers bind
   something statically, so the check asks that the handlers
   rewritten bind something statically only if the handlers did. The
   code of functions is not gone into.

   What is made an alias is what FlambdaLiftSpec.lift_named lifts and
   nothing else: an immutable block ([Make_block], which in the model
   is the immutable one), a boxed number, a closure. A block with
   identity, a call and a load are never moved or shared. This is a
   restriction on the constructors, not a claim that the [Let] has a
   value: a [Let] that boxes a number at a kind that is not its own,
   or makes a block of a symbol that is bound to nothing, is undefined
   where the static binding that stands for it has a value. The unit
   is then undefined there, and the refinement, which is one way, asks
   nothing of the unit lifted.

   Why it is right. The first run makes the block each time the [Let]
   is executed. The second has the symbol, which a group around the
   [Let] has bound to the same constant; between the group and the
   [Let] no variable of the constant is bound again, so the fields
   are the same values, up to FlambdaLiftSpec.value_lifted, as for a
   [Let] lifted where it stands. No primitive and no rule of the
   machine tells the block from the symbol. They differ at an exit of
   the unit, so [lift_around_unit] makes the check of
   FlambdaLiftSpec.lift_unit (FlambdaLiftSpec.exits_plain). It also
   checks that the result is a well-formed unit: a group put is then
   at toplevel, executed once, and binds symbols that are new; and its
   variables are in scope where it stands, so they have values there
   (FlambdaScopeSpec.v). With these the unit lifted refines the unit,
   run on its own ([lift_around_unit_program_refines_statement]).

   Two things that the refinement does not say.

   A group put before a test is bound whichever arm is taken: on the
   path through another arm the second run allocates what the first
   does not. The refinement is of the results of the unit, not of what
   it allocates, as for a [Let] lifted out of code that is never
   called. Nothing but an allocation is brought forward, and it cannot
   be undefined there: the fields of a static block are not tested for
   their kind, nor for being symbols that are bound, and a closure of
   a set is put only at a function slot that the set has.

   Two [Let]s that are made aliases of one symbol give, in the second
   run, the same symbol where the first run has two blocks; and a
   [Let] that is made an alias of a symbol that the unit binds
   already gives that symbol where the first run has a block of its
   own. In the model nothing tells them apart. What is made an alias
   is an immutable block, a boxed number or a closure of this unit,
   which have no identity in the model. A block or an array of this
   unit that has one (mutable or unique) is made by a primitive of the
   heap, which [lift_named] does not lift (FlambdaLiftSpec.v,
   "Identity") and which the step of the core does not execute; a
   value with identity that comes from another unit is not itself
   made an alias by this rewrite. Of the immutable allocated values
   that this rewrite makes aliases, the physical comparison of two has
   no value (FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.eval_phys_equal, decision D19), so a
   unit that compares them is undefined before and after.
   Physical equality of immutable values is outside the model, and
   sharing is what it would see.

   A [Let] in a loop that is made an alias of a symbol bound before
   the loop adds nothing to this: the first run makes the block at
   each round, with the same fields, as no variable of the constant
   is bound again in the loop.

   What is not here: a [Let] in the code of a function made an alias
   of a symbol bound around the code (FlambdaLiftFromCodeSpec.v binds
   a symbol of its own for it).

   The proofs are in FlambdaLiftAroundProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
