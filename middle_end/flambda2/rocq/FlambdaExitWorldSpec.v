(* The world that a run leaves at an exit, and refinement with the worlds
   of two exits related.

   [FlambdaSemanticsSpec.refines] compares two exits by their
   continuation, their values and their heap, each of which must be the
   same. It does not look at the static environment that a run has built
   when it exits: a behaviour does not carry it, and two runs that
   [refines] relates need not build the same (a static binding that is
   not used may be removed, and code is rewritten).

   A statement that relates two exits otherwise than by equality needs
   that static environment: where a value of the second exit is a symbol
   that stands for a value of the first, what the symbol is bound to is
   in the static environment of the second run. Such a statement is
   that of a pass that changes values
   (FlambdaLiftSpec.lift_simulates_statement, which takes the last state
   of the second run by hand). This file gives the form once:
   - [exit_world], what a run leaves at an exit: the continuation, the
     values, the heap, and the static environment of the state that
     takes the last step;
   - [exits_world], that a state exits and leaves a world. The witness
     is a run of that state, so the static environment is that of a
     state of this run and of no other term;
   - [refines_world R], which is [refines] with the worlds of the two
     exits related by [R];
   - [same_exit], the relation at which it is [refines]: the static
     environments are not compared
     ([refines_world_same_statement]).
   Nothing here changes a statement that exists; no relation between
   worlds other than [same_exit] is defined here.

   What is proved is in FlambdaExitWorldProofs.v: every [_statement]
   here. *)

   related by [R] where [refines] asks for the same continuation, values
   and heap. An exit of the source is answered by an exit of the target
   whose world [R] relates to that of the source. And the target ends,
   by an exit or by going wrong, only if the source exits or goes
   wrong: so a source that diverges has a target that does not end.
   Nothing is said of a source that goes wrong. The second part does
   not say that the two end alike; with the first part and
   [FlambdaSemanticsSpec.behaviour_unique_statement], a source that
   exits has a target that exits, with a related world. *)
