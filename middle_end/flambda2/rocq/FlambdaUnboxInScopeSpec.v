(* A rewrite that takes what is known of symbols, applied in the bodies
   of code and in the handlers of recursive continuations with what the
   static bindings in scope make known. With it the unboxing of the
   parameters of continuations knows, in a function and in a loop, the
   static blocks and boxed numbers of the unit.

   This file is to be reviewed: [facts_of_symbols], [symbols_only] and
   [symbols_bound_as], which say what is known of symbols and when it
   holds; [rewrite_code_in_scope] and [rewrite_rec_handlers_in_scope],
   which are extracted and run by the validation of
   middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/; and the statements. The
   validation uses the two in the first phase of its normalisation of
   the term before (FlambdaValidateSpec.normalise_params_round).

   What Simplify does. A symbol has a type from where it is bound, and
   the type of a symbol bound to a block or to a boxed number says what
   it is bound to (simplify/simplify_static_const.ml,
   [simplify_static_const_of_kind_value], which adds the equation on the
   symbol). The code of a function is simplified where the set of
   closures that the function is of is simplified, under the types of
   the symbols bound by then (simplify/simplify_set_of_closures.ml; in
   a group of static bindings the constants that are not closures come
   first, [simplify_static_consts]). The unboxing of a parameter of a
   continuation reads the type of the argument of each application in
   the environment of that application
   (simplify/unboxing/unboxing_epa.ml, [unbox_arg]). So where one path
   of a function gives a join a constant block, [Some 8] say, which
   closure conversion has made a symbol of the unit, and another gives
   [None], Simplify unboxes the parameter of the join as it does where
   the block is made by a [Let]: the application that gives the symbol
   gives the field of its block.

   FlambdaUnboxVariantsSpec.unbox_variants_knowing does that given what
   is known, and FlambdaUnboxVariantsSpec.unbox_variant_params starts
   it with nothing known. Down a term it learns the static blocks and
   boxed numbers of each [Let_static] that it goes under. It does not
   go into code, nor into the handler of a recursive continuation: the
   validation takes a rewrite there by FlambdaNormaliseSpec.rewrite_code
   and FlambdaRecHandlersSpec.rewrite_rec_handlers, which give the
   rewrite the body or the handler alone. So in a function, and in a
   loop, nothing was known of the symbols of the unit.

   What is here. [rewrite_code_in_scope f known] and
   [rewrite_rec_handlers_in_scope f known] are those two with a rewrite
   [f] that takes what is known, and they give it what the static
   bindings in scope make known of their symbols
   ([symbols_under_statics]).

   Where a fact about a symbol is used. Only where the symbol is bound,
   by the place in the term:
   - the body of code is given what is known of the symbols of the
     [Let_static]s that its binding is under, and of the symbols of its
     own group. Code runs at a call, and a call finds the code in the
     static environment, where the [Let_static] of its group put it
     when it bound the symbols of the group: a [Let_static] binds all
     of its group in one step, and a symbol or a code id that is bound
     already is not bound again (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.eval_static_bindings
     has no value). So when the code runs, the symbols of its group are
     bound to what the group binds them to; and so are those of the
     [Let_static]s above, which ran before;
   - the handler of a recursive continuation is given what is known of
     the symbols of the [Let_static]s that its [Let_cont] is under,
     which ran before the handler is first applied.
   A symbol bound further down the unit than the code or the loop is
   not known there, though it may be bound by the time the code runs:
   to know it would take a statement about a unit run on its own
   (FlambdaKnownSymbolsSpec.fold_known_unit_program_refines_statement
   is one), and none is made here. A symbol that the unit imports is
   bound by no [Let_static] of the unit: nothing is known of it.

   So this is a rewrite that refines under all environments, with no
   premise on the unit ([rewrite_code_in_scope_refines_statement],
   [rewrite_rec_handlers_in_scope_refines_statement], at
   [no_facts]). The statements are of every state in which what is
   known holds ([symbols_bound_as]), since that is the form in which
   one is used inside the other: the handlers of the loops of a
   function are rewritten with what is known where the function is
   bound.

   What is known of symbols alone ([facts_of_symbols]). In code no
   variable of the unit is in scope, and a variable of the unit may be
   bound again in a handler. So of a static block whose field is a
   variable, that field is forgotten; the tag and the fields that are
   symbols and constants are kept. What is left mentions no variable
   ([symbols_only]), holds under any variables, and is not changed by a
   renaming.

   Against Simplify: this knows of the symbols of a group in the code
   of that group, which Simplify knows where it simplifies the code
   under the closure; and it does not know, in code bound at the head
   of a unit, a symbol bound further down, which Simplify knows if the
   closure is made further down still. The validation is of terms
   after closure conversion, which binds the constants of a unit at
   its head.

   [unbox_variants_knowing] given what is known of symbols alone
   refines wherever that holds
   ([unbox_variants_knowing_symbols_refines_statement]): it is the
   rewrite that the validation gives the two.

   That the two commute with renaming and keep scope is stated in
   FlambdaUnboxInScopeRenameSpec.v. The proofs are in
   FlambdaUnboxInScopeProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
