(* The values of the machine of FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v, what symbols are
   bound to, and how a value is read.

   This file is to be reviewed: [value], [kind_of_value],
   [statically_allocated_value], the observations [closure_of],
   [block_of], [boxed_number_of], [string_of] and [array_of], and the
   statements that they are exclusive, which FlambdaValueProofs.v
   proves; [import_class],
   [imported_of] and [identity_of]; and the three readings of a closure
   as one of a set,
   [closure_in_set], [project_value_slot] and [project_function_slot],
   whose statements are in FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v. The rest is
   definitions. FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v exports this file, so a file that
   imports the semantics has what is here.

   A value is a constant (a tagged immediate, a naked number of any kind,
   null or poison), a pointer to what a symbol is bound to, or something
   allocated that is immutable: a closure, a block of values, an
   immutable array of values, a boxed number. An allocated value is its
   contents: two of them are the same value when they have the same
   contents, and nothing tells one allocation from another. There is no
   mutable memory.

   A symbol is a value by itself, whether or not it is bound, and what it
   points to is in the static environment. So a block made by a primitive
   and a symbol bound to a block of the same tag and fields are different
   values, although no primitive tells them apart: every reading of an
   allocated value goes through an observation, which takes the static
   environment and answers the same for both. The observations are
   pairwise exclusive: a value is at most one of a closure, a block, a
   boxed number, a string and an immutable array
   ([observations_disjoint_statement], [array_of_disjoint_statement]).

   An immutable array of values is a value that a primitive makes
   ([Value_immutable_array], made by [Make_immutable_array]:
   FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.eval_variadic_primitive), or what a symbol is
   bound to ([Static_immutable_array]): the table that Simplify makes
   of a [Switch] whose arms give one continuation constants
   (simplify/simplify_switch_expr.ml), or an immutable array that it
   lifts. Either is immutable data, as a block is, and not a location
   of the heap: nothing writes it. [array_of] reads both, by the
   elements. The value keeps no array kind: an array of the model
   holds values of kind [Value], and a load says at which kind it
   reads (FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.v).

   A symbol may also be bound to something that the unit imports
   ([Static_imported]): an object of another unit (a predefined
   exception is of a unit of its own), of which the model knows the
   address and its class ([import_class]) and nothing else. An import
   of the class [Import_identity] is an object with an identity, which
   is its symbol ([identity_of]): an exception. One of the class
   [Import_data] is anything else, and is to the model what an
   immutable allocated value of the unit is, without its contents.
   None of the five observations reads an import of either class, so
   it is not a closure, a block, a boxed number, a string or an
   immutable array, and is not allocated in the sense of
   [is_allocated]. Of the unary and binary primitives two have a value
   on it: the identity, which returns it, and physical equality, which
   tells an identity from everything else (FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.v); and
   it can be a field of a block that is made. No static binding of a
   term makes an import: the static environment in which a unit is run
   has them (FlambdaImportsSpec.v).

   A closure is one of a set of closures. The closure of a set of one
   function whose function slot has no name is its code and the values
   of its value slots ([Value_closure], [Static_closure]). The closure
   of a set of functions at named function slots is the slot it is at,
   the code of every function slot of the set, and the values of the
   value slots ([Value_closure_of_set]); the closures of one set differ
   in that slot only, and a closure does not hold the others. A symbol
   bound to a closure of a static set also has the symbols of the
   closures of its set ([Static_closure_of_set]). [closure_of] reads
   any of them as the code of its own function and the value slots;
   [closure_in_set] as the slot, the set and the value slots, the
   unnamed forms being at [unnamed_function_slot] of a set of that one
   function. A value of the shape of a closure at a function slot that
   its set has not got is not a closure: neither reads it. The header
   of FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v says more of sets of closures.

   A boxed number is recognised by the kind of its contents, which is
   one of the naked number kinds that have a boxed form. So the contents
   may be poison of such a kind, and a symbol bound to a boxed poison is
   a boxed number, and allocated. What a primitive does with it is the
   primitive's to say (FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.v). One that asks what a
   value is sees the box: [Is_null] answers no of it, and so does
   [Is_int] without [variant_only], and the identity returns it. Boxing
   a poison and unboxing a boxed poison have no value.

   The kind of a value is that of its constant, and [Value] for
   everything else. *)
