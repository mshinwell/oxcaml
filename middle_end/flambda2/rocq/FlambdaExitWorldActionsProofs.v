(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaExitWorldActionsSpec.v. This file
   needs no review: the statements are there.

   A world is what the last state of a run comes to with the static
   environment of that state, so each statement about [exits_world] is
   that of FlambdaEquivarianceSpec.v or of FlambdaLocationsMachineSpec.v
   about a run, then about a step, with what the action does to the
   static environment of a state. For a permutation of locations the
   run and the last step each give a permutation; the two agree on the
   locations that the heap of the last state binds, the locations of
   its static environment are among those, and a static environment
   moved by two permutations that agree on its locations is the
   same. *)
