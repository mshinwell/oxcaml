(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaDeadParamsSpec.v. Nothing here
   needs review.

   The pass is one more way of choosing the masks of the relation of
   FlambdaUnusedParamsProofs.v ([drops]), which is what that file's
   simulation asks: the second expression is the first with parameters
   and arguments removed as some masks say, the parameters that a mask
   removes not free in the second handler, and with [Let]s removed
   whose variables the second expression does not use. Here the masks
   of a loop are those that the search has found, or the masks that
   keep everything; either way they are the masks that one more round
   computes from them ([settle_fixed]), so each is [used_params] of its
   handler as it is rewritten under them, and that is a mask that fits
   it (FlambdaUnusedParamsProofs.used_params_fit). Nothing is proved of
   the search itself. *)
