(* Lifting out of the arms of a test at the toplevel of a unit: a
   [Let], outside code, of a closure, an immutable block or a boxed
   number whose parts are symbols and constants, made a static binding
   of a symbol at the head of the unit.

   This file is to be reviewed: [lift_to_head], against what Simplify
   does (below); [lift_to_head_unit], which is extracted and run by the
   validation of middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/; and the
   statements.

   What Simplify does. A static binding stands only at the toplevel of
   a unit: in the unit itself, and in a handler that all of its body
   goes to (FlambdaWellFormedSpec.handler_at_toplevel). The arms of a
   test that is not resolved are handlers that are not at toplevel:

     let f = if c then (fun x -> x + 1) else (fun x -> x + 2)

   has one handler for each arm, each making a closure, and
   FlambdaLiftSpec.lift_expr, which makes a [Let] a static binding
   where it stands, cannot be used there. Simplify lifts the two
   closures, which need nothing from around them, as it lifts out of
   the code of a function (FlambdaLiftFromCodeSpec.v), and places
   their bindings, in one group, at the nearest place at toplevel that
   it comes back through: under the last [Let] before the test, in the
   unit or in the handler at toplevel that the test is in.

   What is here. [lift_to_head] makes the [Let]s at the paths given
   aliases of symbols (FlambdaLiftFromCodeSpec.lift_from_code, with no
   code named), and binds the symbols in one group around the unit
   (FlambdaLiftFromCodeSpec.lifted_out_bindings):

     e   becomes   Let_static bindings e'

   where [e'] is [e] with [Let x = Symbol s in ...] for each [Let]
   lifted. This is not where Simplify binds them. The validation
   brings the two terms together otherwise: it compares them with
   their static bindings that mention no variable bound first. As for
   the lifting out of code, only a [Let] that mentions no variable is
   lifted (FlambdaLiftFromCodeSpec.closed_named), the variable stays,
   bound to the symbol, a [Let] is named by its path in the unit, the
   handlers of recursive continuations are gone into and the bodies
   of code are not, two [Let]s that are given one symbol and make the
   same constant have one binding
   (FlambdaLiftFromCodeSpec.once_each, and the header of that file
   for what is refused), and which [Let]s, to which symbols, is a
   guess of the caller's, of which nothing is believed. The guess may
   name any such [Let] of the unit, in a handler that is at toplevel
   or in the unit itself as well as in the arm of a test or in a
   loop.

   Why it is right. As for the lifting out of code: the first run
   makes a closure, a block or a boxed number when the [Let] is
   executed, and the second has the symbol, bound before anything else
   of the unit runs, to the same thing; the two values are related by
   FlambdaLiftSpec.value_lifted. The checks are the same
   ([lift_to_head_unit]): the unit exits with symbols and constants
   only, and the result is a well-formed unit, so that the symbols
   given are new and distinct. The binding of a symbol cannot itself
   be undefined, for the reasons given in FlambdaLiftFromCodeSpec.v;
   so a [Let] that is never executed brings no undefinedness to the
   unit lifted.

   The proofs are in FlambdaLiftFromArmsProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
