(* Seven bodies of code in which Simplify unboxed a variant that is the
   parameter of a join, and the validation of each once
   [unbox_variant_params] is in the round of the term before.

   This file is to be reviewed: the bodies, against the sources below;
   the round; and the statements.

   [option_heap] is

     external on_heap : 'a -> 'a = "%identity"

     let[@inline never] f : bool -> int -> int =
      fun c x ->
       let v = if c then Some (x + 1) else None in
       match on_heap v with None -> 0 | Some y -> y + 2

   One branch makes the block of [Some] and the other gives the
   constant [None]; the continuation of the [let] tests whether its
   parameter is an immediate and, where it is not, loads the field.
   Simplify gives that continuation two parameters and not the option:
   whether it is an immediate, and the field. The branch of [Some]
   gives 0 and what it computed, and makes no block; the branch of
   [None] gives 1 and the constant [poison] of the kind of values.
   ([on_heap] is there so that the option is not allocated in a
   region: the model has no regions yet. The front end removes it.)

   [list_heap] is the same of a list, [[x + 1]] or [[]], matched by
   [[] -> x + 3 | y :: _ -> y + 2]: both arms of the match are
   continuations, and only the head of the list is read.

   [shape_heap] is

     type shape = Empty | Full | Pair of int * int

     let[@inline never] f : bool -> int -> int =
      fun c x ->
       let v = if c then Pair (x + 1, x) else Full in
       match on_heap v with Empty -> 0 | Full -> 1 | Pair (a, b) -> a + b

   The front end returns the value itself for the two constant
   constructors, so the parameter stays, and the block is still made;
   the continuation gets three more parameters, whether the value is
   an immediate and the two fields, and the branch of [Full] gives
   [poison] for both fields.

   [shape2_heap] is [shape_heap] with [Empty -> 10 | Full -> x + 20]
   for the two constant constructors. The handler then reads which
   constant constructor its parameter is, by an untagging, under the
   test that it is an immediate; Simplify makes that a parameter too,
   the first, and the branch of [Pair] gives 0 for it. The value is
   no longer a parameter and no block is made.

   [nested_heap] is an option of a pair, [Some (x + 1, x)] or [None],
   matched by [None -> 0 | Some (a, b) -> a + b]. Simplify unboxes the
   option and then the pair: the continuation gets whether the value
   is an immediate and the two fields of the pair, and the branch of
   [None] gives [poison] for both. On the term before, the pair is
   first made a parameter, which the branch of [None] gives [poison];
   its two fields are then read from that parameter, and a load has no
   value on the constant [poison] either.

   [either_heap] is

     type either = Left of int | Right of int * int

     let[@inline never] f : bool -> int -> int =
      fun c x ->
       let v = if c then Left (x + 1) else Right (x, x + 2) in
       match on_heap v with Left y -> y + 3 | Right (y, z) -> y + z

   Both branches make a block, of two tags, and the continuation of
   the [let] goes by the tag to the continuation of one constructor,
   which loads its fields. Simplify gives the continuation the tag and
   the fields of both constructors, those of [Right] first, and each
   branch gives [poison] for the fields of the other constructor. The
   loads say nothing of the tag, so the load of the field of [Left]
   has a value on the block of [Right]: here the pass gives [poison]
   because the branch of [Right] gives the tag 1, with which the
   handler does not come to the continuation of [Left]
   (FlambdaUnboxVariantsSpec.never_reads).

   [int64_option_heap] is

     let[@inline never] f : bool -> int64 -> int64 =
      fun c x ->
       let v = if c then Some (add x 1L) else None in
       match on_heap v with None -> 0L | Some y -> add y 2L

   with the arithmetic of %int64_add. The branch of [Some] boxes a
   number and makes the block of it; the continuation of the [let]
   loads the field and unboxes it. Simplify unboxes the option and then
   the number: the continuation gets whether the value is an immediate
   and the number, the branch of [Some] gives the number that it
   computed, and boxes nothing, and the branch of [None] gives [poison]
   of the kind of the number. On the term before, the field is first
   made a parameter, and then its unboxing, which is under the test:
   the branch of [Some] gives the number in the box that it made
   (FlambdaUnboxVariantsSpec.made_number). The two constants [1L] and
   [2L] are symbols that the unit binds to boxed numbers, which the
   body unboxes; they are written here as the numbers, and the boxed
   [0L] that the branch of [None] returns as the symbol 1.

   [while_two_tests] is

     let result =
       let n = opaque 10 in
       let i = ref 0 in
       let s = ref 0 in
       while !i < n && !s < 20 do
         s := !s + !i;
         i := !i + 1
       done;
       !s

   The [&&] is a join in the handler of the loop: the continuation
   after the two tests takes a boolean, which the first test gives as
   the constant [false] and the second as its comparison, tagged; it
   untags the boolean for its [Switch]. Simplify gives that
   continuation the number untagged: 0 from the first test, the
   comparison itself from the second, and nothing is tagged. On the
   term before, the untagging is not the first thing in the handler
   of the join, as the continuation of the body of the loop is bound
   above it; so the argument must be certain to be a naked immediate:
   the constant, and the number that the second test tagged
   (FlambdaUnboxVariantsSpec.made_number). The body here is the
   handler of the loop. The front end has made the two references
   parameters of the loop, 1 and 2, and of each continuation in it;
   the bound [n] is the variable 3, the loop is the continuation 2
   and its exit the continuation 1, which is given the result alone.

   [shape_constant] is the body of a unit in which

     type shape = Empty | Full | Box of int

     let v = if c then Box 8 else Empty in
     match v with Empty -> 1 | Full -> 2 | Box y -> y

   is not in a function. The block [Box 8] is a constant, so the unit
   binds a symbol to it, and the join is given that symbol or the
   constant [Empty]. Simplify gives the continuation whether the value
   is an immediate and the field, 8 from the symbol and [poison] from
   [Empty]; the constant constructor it finds to be the first on both
   paths. On the term before, the untagging of the value is under the
   test of whether it is an immediate, and the path of the symbol has
   nothing to untag: a symbol is never an immediate
   (FlambdaUnboxVariantsSpec.no_value_on), so that path gives 0, as
   the other does, and the parameter is then bound to it and the
   [Switch] on it folded. The load is given the field of the symbol,
   a constant, by what is known of the static block in scope. The
   condition is the variable 1 and the return continuation is 1; the
   symbol is 1, and its binding, which nothing uses in the end, is
   kept in both bodies.

   The bodies are those of the function of each source: the body
   before Simplify and the body after. They are written by hand from
   the two terms that the compiler prints ([-drawfexpr-to] and
   [-dfexpr-to]). The binding of the depth variable of the code, which
   has nothing in the model, is left out; the names are numbered here.
   The units themselves are in
   middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/ocaml/ ([option_heap.ml] and the
   others), where the validation is run on the whole of each.

   [round_with_variants] is
   FlambdaUnboxParamsExamplesSpec.round_with_unboxing with
   [unbox_variant_params] for [unbox_known_params]. It is here for the
   examples only; the validation does not run it.

   What is said of each body: the body before, after five such rounds,
   is the body after up to bound names ([..._validated_statement]);
   after five rounds of FlambdaValidateSpec.normalise_expr_before,
   which has no unboxing of parameters, it is not
   ([..._not_validated_today_statement]: the statements were written
   before the validation ran the pass, and their names are kept); and
   the body after refines
   the body before, under all environments ([..._refines_statement]),
   which follows from the first by the theorems of the passes and of
   the comparison. So the constant [poison] that Simplify gives where
   there is no field is where the pass gives it. Of [poison] that says
   what the refinement says and no more: a run of the body before that
   is defined is matched by the body after; where the body before is
   undefined, as it is if it comes to a read that has no value,
   nothing is claimed of the body after.

   The two bodies that FlambdaUnboxParamsExamplesSpec.v validates with
   its round are validated with this one too
   ([earlier_examples_validated_statement]).

   The validation runs the pass in the first phase of its
   normalisation of the term before
   (FlambdaValidateSpec.normalise_expr_params). Five rounds of that
   phase take each of the seven bodies of this file to the body after,
   and the three of the other file too, [pair_built] among them, which
   the round of that file does not validate
   ([bodies_validated_by_first_phase_statement]). They take the body
   of [while_two_tests] to its body after as well
   ([while_two_tests_validated_statement]), so that body after refines
   the body before ([while_two_tests_refines_statement]); the round
   of this file does not, as it binds no parameter that every
   application gives the same thing. The same is said of
   [shape_constant] ([shape_constant_validated_statement],
   [shape_constant_refines_statement]).

   The last examples are whole terms, with a symbol that a function,
   or a loop, is given where it is bound. [constant_join] is the body
   of the function of

     let[@inline never] f : bool -> int -> int =
      fun c x ->
       let v = if c then Some 8 else None in
       match v with None -> x | Some y -> x + y

   The block [Some 8] is a constant, which closure conversion makes a
   symbol of the unit, bound before the code of [f]; the join in the
   body is given that symbol or the constant [None]. Simplify gives
   the join whether the value is an immediate and the field: 8 from
   the symbol and [poison] from [None]. The body alone says nothing of
   the symbol. A round of the first phase for a whole term
   (FlambdaValidateSpec.normalise_params_round) gives the round for
   the body of code what the static bindings in scope make known
   (FlambdaUnboxInScopeSpec.rewrite_code_in_scope), and the round for
   the handler of a loop likewise
   (FlambdaUnboxInScopeSpec.rewrite_rec_handlers_in_scope). So:
   - [constant_in_code] binds the symbol and the code in one group.
     Five such rounds take it to the term with the join unboxed
     ([constant_in_code_validated_statement]), which therefore refines
     it ([constant_in_code_refines_statement]);
   - [constant_below_code] binds the code first and the symbol under
     it. The symbol is not in scope where the code is bound, and five
     rounds leave the term as it is
     ([constant_below_code_left_statement]);
   - [constant_in_loop] has the same join in the handler of a
     recursive continuation under the binding of the symbol; the two
     parameters of the handler are 1 and 2, and it is applied once, to
     the variables 1 and 2 of the term. Five rounds unbox the join
     there ([constant_in_loop_validated_statement],
     [constant_in_loop_refines_statement]).
   In the three the symbol is 1 and the code id is 1; the parameters
   of the code are [c], 1, and [x], 2, its closure variable is 3 and
   its return and exception continuations are 1 and 2. In the two
   terms with code, the code is not called: the body of the term
   returns a constant to the continuation 1, and only the bindings
   matter. The term with the loop applies its handler, which returns
   [x], or [x] and 8 added, to the continuation 1.

   Three bodies more, for what the pass gives where Simplify's rule
   is by the box and not by the path that the handler takes:
   - [pair_constant] is the body of

       fun c x ->
        match if c then x, true else 0, false with
        | v, true -> v
        | _, false -> -7

     The handler of the join reads the first field only where the
     second is [true], and the arm of the constant pair gives
     [false]. Simplify gives that arm the first field of its pair, 0:
     a pair has one tag, and its fields are given wherever the pair
     is. The second field is no test of the pair, so the pass does
     not take it to show that the arm does not come to the read
     ([pair_constant_validated_statement],
     [pair_constant_refines_statement]).
   - [option_pair] is the body of

       fun c x ->
        match if c then Some (x, true) else None with
        | Some (n, b) -> if b then n else 0
        | None -> -1

     The arm of [None] gives [poison] for the untagging of the
     boolean, as for the fields: the boolean is a number, not the
     constant constructor of a variant, of which nothing tests
     [Is_int] ([option_pair_validated_statement],
     [option_pair_refines_statement]).
   - [option_fields] is the body of

       fun c x ->
        match if c then Some (3, x) else None with
        | Some (low, high) -> high + low
        | None -> 0

     The handler loads the first field of the pair, then the second;
     the new parameters are the second, then the first, as Simplify
     has them ([option_fields_validated_statement],
     [option_fields_refines_statement]).
   In the three the continuation of the join is 2 and its parameter
   is 3.

   One body more, for a load that the pass leaves. [two_tags] is the
   body of

       type side = Left of int | Right of int | Neither

       fun c x ->
        match if c then Left x else Right x with
        | Left v | Right v -> v + 1
        | Neither -> 0

   Both arms make a block, of two tags, and the handler of the join
   tests whether its parameter is an immediate and then loads the
   field that the two constructors share, without going by the tag.
   Simplify finds that the value is an immediate on neither arm and
   removes the test; the two blocks, the parameter and the load
   stay. The pass makes the test a parameter, which both arms give 0
   and the round then removes, and leaves the load: blocks of two
   tags come to it (FlambdaUnboxVariantsSpec.loads_of_two_tags). So
   the rounds take the body before to the body after
   ([two_tags_validated_statement], [two_tags_refines_statement]).
   The continuation of the join is 2 and its parameter is 3; the
   continuations that make the blocks are 4 and 5. The front end
   allocates the two blocks in a region that it opens in the body and
   closes after the join; the model has no regions, and the bodies
   are written without it.

   One body more, for an argument that the term has already read.
   [int64_max] is the body of

       fun a b ->
        let m = if less a b then b else a in
        add m 1L

   on boxed 64-bit integers. The comparison unboxes [a] and [b]; each
   arm gives the join one of the two boxes, and the handler unboxes
   what it is given. Simplify gives the join the number: on each arm
   the one that the comparison unboxed, which is in scope. Neither box
   is made in the body, so nothing is known of what is in it but that
   a [Let] above has read it (FlambdaUnboxParamsSpec.reads_under_let),
   and the pass gives the variable of that [Let]
   ([int64_max_validated_statement], [int64_max_refines_statement]).
   The parameters of the code are [a], 1, and [b], 2; the continuation
   of the join is 2 and its parameter is 3; the constant [1L] is
   written as the number, as the constants of [int64_option_heap] are.

   One body more, for what a handler reads in two places.
   [matched_twice] is the body of

       fun c x ->
        let o = if c then Some (x + 1) else None in
        let a = match o with None -> 0 | Some y -> y in
        let b = match o with None -> 10 | Some y -> y * 2 in
        a + b

   The handler of the join tests its parameter twice and loads its
   field twice, the second test and the second load in the
   continuation that the first match goes to. Simplify gives the join
   two parameters, whether the option is an immediate and its
   contents, and each test and each load is of them. The pass makes
   the first test a parameter and the second a [Let] of it, and the
   same for the loads (FlambdaUnboxVariantsSpec.share_reads); the
   rounds follow those [Let]s
   ([matched_twice_validated_statement],
   [matched_twice_refines_statement]). The parameters of the code are
   [c], 1, and [x], 2; the continuation of the join is 2 and its
   parameter is 3; the continuations of the two matches are 3 and 4,
   with parameters 4 and 5. The region of the block is left out, as
   in [two_tags].

   The proofs are in FlambdaUnboxVariantsExamplesProofs.v, which needs
   no review. *)
