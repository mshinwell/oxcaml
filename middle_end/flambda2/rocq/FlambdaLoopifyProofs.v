(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaLoopifySpec.v. Nothing here needs
   review.

   The term and the term with code made loops differ in what the static
   environment binds code ids to, and nowhere else: the two runs execute
   the same expressions until code that was made a loop is called. So
   the proof is first about two states with one expression under static
   environments that differ so ([statics_loop]), and then about the
   [Let_static] that makes them differ.

   The two runs are followed side by side, each step of the first
   answered by one or more of the second
   (FlambdaSimulationProofs.stuttering_refines). The relation
   ([state_loops]) has two cases.

   - Outside a loop the expressions are the same, the variables are the
     same, and each continuation name stands in the two states for
     related continuations ([cont_rel]).
   - Inside the body of code that was made a loop, since a call of it
     ([frame]: the code, the closure it was called with, and what the
     second run had at the entry), the second expression is the first
     with its self tail calls made jumps; the variables give the same
     value to every name, though the second has the parameters bound
     once more for each time round; [my_closure] is still the closure
     called; and in the second state [self] stands for the closure of
     the loop made at the entry, and the return and exception
     continuations for what they stood for there.

   A call of code that was made a loop takes one step in the first run
   and three in the second, which binds [self] and jumps to it; the two
   are then inside the loop. A self tail call there takes one step in
   each: the first calls the code again, which is found by the closure
   as it was at the entry ([frame_statics]), and the second jumps; the
   two are inside the loop again, with the same frame. A self tail call
   is a full call, so it is not a partial application nor an
   over-application.

   A call is of the same shape in the two runs
   (FlambdaSemanticsProofs.shape_of_call_related), of code that is the
   same or was made a loop. What is left of an over-application is a
   continuation that makes a call when it is applied, so applying
   related continuations may also take three steps in the second run
   ([result_loops]).

   The handler of [self] has no step unless the values it is applied to
   are of the kinds of the parameters of the code
   (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.apply_cont_value). They are: a call that has a
   step gave values of those kinds ([agreed_kinds]); at the entry the
   jump passes the parameters, which are distinct, so their values are
   the arguments of the call ([eval_params_bound]); and a self tail call
   is such a call too.

   A continuation closure made inside a loop may be applied much later,
   when the static environment has grown. What is known of the static
   environment where it was made still holds ([cont_rel_extend]); that
   is why the relation on continuations is indexed by the static
   environment of the first state. *)
