(* Lifting: a [Let] of a closure, an immutable block or a boxed number
   made a static binding of a symbol.

   This file is to be reviewed: [lift_named] and [lift_expr], against
   what Simplify does (below); [exits_plain]; [lift_unit], which is
   extracted and run by the validation of
   middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/; the relation [value_lifted];
   and the statements.

   What Simplify does. Where it simplifies a [Let] it may bind a symbol
   in place of the variable and replace the variable by the symbol:
   - a set of closures, when its variables are bound at normal name
     mode and each of its value slots is a constant, a symbol, or a
     variable defined at the toplevel of the unit or known to be a
     projection from a symbol, with a coercion that has no free
     variable (simplify/simplify_set_of_closures.ml,
     [type_value_slots_and_make_lifting_decision_for_one_set], the
     definition of [can_lift], and [simplify_and_lift_set_of_closures]);
     a variable defined at toplevel, in a set that may be allocated
     locally, must also be proved never to hold a local value
     ([T.never_holds_locally_allocated_values]; a projection from a
     symbol is exempt); the symbols are named after the function slots;
   - the result of a primitive that only allocates, bound at normal name
     mode, for which the simplification of the primitive asks for it
     ([try_reify]), when the type that Simplify has of the result can be
     rebuilt as a static constant: an immutable block of values, a boxed
     number, an immutable array (simplify/simplify_named.ml,
     [allow_lifting]; simplify/lifting/reification.ml, [try_to_reify],
     [create_static_const] and [lift]; types/reify.ml, [reify]); the
     symbol is named after the variable, unless an equal constant has
     been lifted already, when the symbol of that one is used
     ([DA.find_shareable_constant] in [lift]).
   Neither asks that the [Let] is at the toplevel of the unit: a
   constant whose parts are constants and symbols is lifted out of a
   function or a loop, its binding being placed at toplevel. The model
   has no name modes, no coercions and no local allocations, so none of
   these conditions is one of [lift_named]: what it lifts that Simplify
   would not is compared with a term in which it is not lifted, and
   fails there.

   What is here. [lift_expr] makes the [Let]s that it is told to into
   static bindings, each where it stands:

     Let x = Closure_of_set slot function_decls value_slots in body
       becomes
     Let_static (bind_closures closure_symbols function_decls value_slots)
       (Let x = Symbol s in body)        with s the symbol of [slot]

     Let x = Make_block tag fields in body
       becomes
     Let_static [Bind_symbol s (Static_const_block tag fields)]
       (Let x = Symbol s in body)

     Let x = Box_number kind contents in body
       becomes
     Let_static [Bind_symbol s (Static_const_boxed_number contents)]
       (Let x = Symbol s in body)

   and likewise the closure of a set of one function whose function slot
   is not named ([Set_of_closures], to [Static_const_set_of_closures]):
   the test tool still converts a unit that has only such sets to these
   forms.

   The variable stays, bound to the symbol; following the alias and
   removing the [Let] are other passes
   (../types/rocq/FlambdaAliasesSpec.follow_aliases,
   FlambdaNormaliseSpec.remove_unused_lets). The fields and the value
   slots are not touched: where one is a variable, the static constant
   is computed where the [Let] was, from the same variable. The other
   closures of a set are not looked for: a projection of a function slot
   from [x] stays a projection, now from a symbol.

   In the code of a lifted closure, [my_closure] is then the symbol:
   Simplify simplifies the code where it lifts the set, with the type
   of [my_closure] an alias of the symbol, so that a recursive function
   calls itself through its symbol. [lift_unit] does it too, by
   FlambdaMyClosureSpec.bind_my_closures, for the code ids and symbols
   that the guess names, and checks what that needs: the unit lifted
   makes no other closure of that code
   (FlambdaMyClosureSpec.only_closures_of).

   Which [Let]s, to which symbols, and which code is that of which
   symbol, is a guess of the caller's ([lifting]), read off the term
   after Simplify; nothing is believed of it. A [Let] is named by where
   it is in the term ([path]: the handler of a non-recursive
   continuation is to one side and what follows a binding to the
   other), not by its variable, so that two [Let]s of one variable are
   told apart and renaming the term changes nothing
   ([lift_expr_equivariant_statement]). The bodies of code and the
   handlers of recursive continuations are not gone into.

   Why it is not a rewrite like the others. The variable was a closure,
   and is now a symbol bound to that closure: different values. No
   primitive and no rule of the machine tells them apart
   (FlambdaValueSpec.v: every reading is an observation), but the
   continuation that the term leaves through is given the value itself
   ([Exits]). So the term lifted does not refine the term under all
   environments, nor even run on its own, if a lifted value reaches the
   exit. What is true is stated twice:

   - [lift_simulates_statement]: run on their own, the term and the term
     lifted end alike, with values at the exit that are the same up to
     [value_lifted]: where the first has a closure, a block or a boxed
     number, the second may have a symbol bound to it, here and inside
     closures and blocks. The first premise is that the term lifted is a
     well-formed unit (FlambdaWellFormedSpec.well_formed_unit), which is
     what keeps each new binding from being executed twice and each new
     symbol from being bound already: a [Let] in a loop or in code, or
     two [Let]s given one symbol, are refused by it. The second is that
     the term lifted makes one closure only, the symbol, of each code in
     which [my_closure] was bound to a symbol.
   - [lift_unit_program_refines_statement]: if moreover the term gives
     only symbols and constants to the continuations it may leave
     through ([exits_plain]), the values at the exit are equal, and the
     term lifted refines the term, run on its own
     (FlambdaUnusedStaticsSpec.program_refines). [lift_unit] checks
     both, and this is the statement that
     FlambdaValidateSpec.validate_unit uses. A unit made from an OCaml
     source leaves with the symbol of its module block, and passes.

   [exits_plain] is a check on a term, with a statement of its own
   ([exits_plain_sound_statement]): a unit that passes it exits with symbols
   and constants only. It follows the continuations in scope: one bound
   by a [Let_cont], and the return continuation of code, never stand for
   a way out, provided that every call returns to such a one; so a
   variable may be given to them. Any other continuation, the exception
   continuation of code included, may be the way out of the unit, and
   is given symbols and constants only.

   What is not here, and makes a unit "not validated" rather than
   wrongly accepted:
   - lifting out of a function, where the binding moves to toplevel:
     that is FlambdaLiftFromCodeSpec.v, for what mentions no variable;
   - lifting out of a loop;
   - the sharing of equal constants: a symbol is bound once, so two
     [Let]s cannot be given the same symbol;
   - immutable arrays, which the model has not got;
   - a unit that gives a variable to its return continuation, or raises
     a variable in code: see the CR at [exits_plain].

   Identity. The model's [Make_block] is the immutable one only
   (FlambdaPrimitiveModel.v) and its values have no identity, so nothing
   lifted here has one. Simplify also lifts a block that is
   [Immutable_unique] (reification.ml, [create_static_const]), out of
   functions too, which changes how many blocks there are. When the
   model has mutability, [lift_named] must fire on [Immutable] only.

   The proofs are in FlambdaLiftProofs.v, which needs no review. They
   need one law of the primitives that the others do not give: a
   primitive applied to arguments related by [value_lifted] has a value
   related to the value it had
   (FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.eval_prim_related_statement). *)

   closure of a set with named function slots, [statics'] binds the
   symbols of the whole set, each to the closure at its slot
   ([static_set_bound]), and the set has a symbol for each function
   slot. A constant is lifted to itself only, and so is a symbol. A
   partial application is lifted to a partial application, of the value
   it calls lifted, to its arguments lifted, at the same arity: none is
   made a symbol.

   The relation speaks of the second static environment only. A symbol
   is related to itself whatever it is bound to, in either run
   ([Lifted_symbol]): by itself that says nothing of what the two runs
   read through it. It is one part of the simulation of
   FlambdaLiftProofs.v, which has beside it that every symbol the first
   run binds, the second binds to the same thing, lifted. A symbol that
   only the second run binds, one of those given to a lifted [Let], may
   be mentioned by the first term; nothing can be read through it

(* The term lifted, with [my_closure] bound to its symbol in the code
   that [known] names, run on its own, ends as the term does, up to
   [value_lifted] at the exit: an exit of the term is one of the term
   lifted, through the same continuation, with values lifted under the
   static environment that the second run has reached; and if the term
   lifted ends, so does the term, or it goes wrong. (By the first part
   the term then ends alike, as a run has one behaviour.) *)
