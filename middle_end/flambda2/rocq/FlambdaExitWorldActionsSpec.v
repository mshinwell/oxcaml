(* The two actions on what a run leaves at an exit.

   This file is to be reviewed: [rename_exit_world],
   [rename_world_relation], [permute_exit_world],
   [world_locations_bound], and the statements.

   FlambdaExitWorldSpec.v has what a run leaves at an exit
   ([exit_world]: the continuation, the values, the heap, and the
   static environment of the state that takes the last step), that a
   state leaves a world ([exits_world]), and refinement with the
   worlds of the two exits related ([refines_world]).
   FlambdaEquivarianceSpec.v has the action of the renamings of
   variables and continuations on states, and FlambdaLocationsSpec.v
   that of the permutations of locations. This file extends both to a
   world, and says how [exits_world] and [refines_world] go through
   them.

   A renaming. A world is renamed as the state that leaves it is
   ([rename_exit_world]): its continuation is renamed, as the
   continuation of an exit is; the code of its static environment is
   renamed; its values and its heap hold no variables or
   continuations and are left. The action has inverses
   ([rename_exit_world_inverse_statement]). A state leaves a world
   exactly when the state renamed leaves the world renamed
   ([exits_world_equivariant_statement]). It has no premise, as the
   statements about a step and a run have none.
   Refinement with the worlds related is kept with the relation
   renamed as the two states are ([rename_world_relation],
   [refines_world_equivariant_statement]). So it is kept, at the
   relation as it is, where the renaming keeps the relation
   ([refines_world_kept_statement]). [same_exit], at which
   [refines_world] is FlambdaSemanticsSpec.refines, is such a
   relation for every renaming ([same_exit_equivariant_statement]).

   A permutation of locations. A world is moved in its values, in the
   statically allocated values of its static environment and in its
   heap ([permute_exit_world]); its continuation is no location and
   code holds none. The premise is that of
   FlambdaLocationsMachineSpec.v: the heap of the state binds every
   location of the state. Under it the world that the state leaves
   has its locations bound by its heap ([world_locations_bound]),
   those of its static environment among them, and a location that
   the heap of the state bound is bound by the heap of the world
   ([exits_world_keeps_locations_bound_statement]). A run that
   allocates chooses its locations, so the state moved leaves the
   world moved up to a second permutation, which agrees with the
   first on every location that the heap of the state binds
   ([exits_world_permuted_statement]). That agreement is all that is
   said of the second permutation. [same_exit] is kept where the two
   worlds are moved by one permutation
   ([same_exit_permuted_statement]). The two actions commute
   ([rename_permute_exit_world_statement]).

   What is not here. Refinement with the worlds related, under a
   permutation of locations: the source and the target each leave
   their world up to a permutation of their own, so the relation
   would have to be kept where its two worlds are moved by two
   permutations that agree on the locations bound at the start.
   [same_exit] is not: it compares values and heaps by [=].

   Nothing is trusted here. The proofs are in
   FlambdaExitWorldActionsProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
