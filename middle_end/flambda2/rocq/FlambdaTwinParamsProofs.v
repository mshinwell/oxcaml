(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaTwinParamsSpec.v. Nothing here
   needs review.

   The term and its result run side by side under a relation of
   states ([state_rel]): the same expression, where neither run is in
   a term that the pass rewrote; or an expression that the test
   accepts and the same rewritten, under continuations that are
   closures of a handler and of that handler rewritten. The relation
   has a number, the [Let]s at the head of a handler that the term
   has still to run and the result has not: the term runs each alone,
   and the two runs are in step everywhere else, so that the result
   refines the term by FlambdaLaggingProofs.counted_lagging_refines.

   The variables ([vars_rel]): while such [Let]s are still to come,
   the two runs agree on every variable but those that the [Let]s
   bind, which are parameters in the result and hold there already
   what the parameters that the [Let]s read hold; once a [Let] has
   run they agree on its variable too. A variable that has a twin
   holds in the result what its twin holds, so an argument and the
   untagging of the one are those of the other. *)
