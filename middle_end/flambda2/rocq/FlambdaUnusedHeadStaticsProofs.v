(* Proofs for FlambdaUnusedHeadStaticsSpec.v. This file needs no review.

   The term without the bindings is the source and the term with them
   the target: where the first has a step, the second has the same one.
   Two things make it so.

   - The machine does not lose a step when its static environment binds
     more ([step_more]): a lookup that succeeded succeeds, and no step
     but that of a [Let_static] looks at what is not bound.
   - The two runs are related by the erasure of
     FlambdaUnusedStaticsProofs.v, read the other way, with what it
     does not say: the static environment of the run with the bindings
     has everything that the other has, and what it has more is of the
     names removed ([only_more]). While the groups at the head run, the
     run with the bindings binds a name removed where the other binds
     nothing, and that is defined by the checks of
     [head_statics_removable] ([head_group_evaluates]). Under the head
     the two expressions are the same one, and so are the
     continuations; a [Let_static] there binds no name removed, as
     erasing it changes nothing, so what it binds is fresh in both
     static environments or in neither. *)
