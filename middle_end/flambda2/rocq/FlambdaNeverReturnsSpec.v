(* Calls of code that never returns: a normalisation of the term before
   Simplify that is a refinement.

   This file is to be reviewed: [never_returns_b], [invalid_params],
   [cut_return], [returns_to_invalid] and [cut_returns], which the
   validation of middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/ is to run on the
   term before (it does not yet: FlambdaValidateSpec.v does not name
   them, and nothing extracts them), and the statements.

   Simplify gives a call no return continuation where the type of the
   callee's result is bottom ([Never_returns]; simplify_apply_expr.ml).
   The model has no such call. The test tool converts one to a call
   that returns to a continuation bound around it and used nowhere
   else, whose handler is [Invalid] (the trust ledger, "Calls that
   never return"; requests/C5-never-returns.md, form B). The term
   before has, for the same call, the return continuation that the
   front end gave it. So the two terms differ, and the validation
   needs a rewrite of the term before that gives such a call the same
   shape.

   [cut_returns] is that rewrite. It goes down the term with the code
   that the groups of static bindings above have bound, as
   FlambdaNormaliseSpec.inline_calls does. A direct call of such code
   whose body does not mention its return continuation is put under a
   binding of the call's own return continuation to a handler that is
   [Invalid]:

       apply f (x) -> k * e
     becomes
       apply f (x) -> k * e   where k (r) = invalid

   The tests ([never_returns_b]):
   - the body of the code does not mention its return continuation
     (FlambdaUnusedContsSpec.cont_free_b, which may say that a
     continuation is free when it is not, never the reverse). Then no
     run of the body applies it, whatever it is bound to: the lemma is
     [call_code_never_returns_statement];
   - the code is not tupled, and the call gives at least as many
     arguments as the code has parameters, so it is a full call or an
     over-application and not a partial application: a partial
     application is given to the return continuation at once
     (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.run_call). In an over-application the full
     call inside returns to what is left of the application, and it is
     that full call which never returns;
   - the return and exception continuations of the call are two
     names: the binding is of the first, and must not capture the
     second.

   Names. The rewrite makes none. The continuation that it binds is
   the call's own, bound again around the call: inside the binding the
   call returns to the new handler, and outside nothing changes. The
   parameters of the handler are names that the code binds, its
   closure variable and then its parameters, as many as the call has
   results ([invalid_params]); where the code has too few the call is
   left as it is. They are bound in a handler that is [Invalid], so
   they are read by nothing. So the rewrite commutes with renaming
   exactly, the code known being renamed with the term
   ([cut_returns_equivariant_statement]), and keeps scope
   (FlambdaNeverReturnsScopeSpec.v). It does not keep the binders of a
   term distinct: the comparison of the validation is up to bound
   names, and its rounds rename binders apart themselves
   (FlambdaRenameApartSpec.v).

   A call that is already under such a binding is left
   ([returns_to_invalid]), so the rewrite applied again changes
   nothing more there, and the form that the tool's conversion makes
   is left as it is.

   What is known is the code of the groups above, not that of the
   group that binds the body being rewritten: a call, in code, of code
   of its own group is left. The test is on the body as it is when the
   rewrite runs: code that never returns only because of a call in it
   that never returns ([let fail2 () = fail ()]) passes the test once
   that call has been rewritten, which is the case when its code is
   bound by a later group, or in a later round.

   [cut_returns_refines_statement]: the term refines its result, under
   all environments. It is a rewrite of the term before only: the
   converse is not claimed (it holds of the calls rewritten, but the
   statement that the validation uses is the refinement).

   The proofs are in FlambdaNeverReturnsProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
