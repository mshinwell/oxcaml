(* The static bindings of a unit that need nothing from around them
   bound first: a normalisation of a unit that is run on its own.

   This file is to be reviewed: [is_hoisted], [hoisted_bindings],
   [without_hoisted] and [hoist_statics], which are extracted and run
   by the validation of middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/, and the
   statements.

   The two terms of a unit do not bind their symbols in the same
   places. Simplify lifts a closure, a block or a boxed number whose
   parts are symbols and constants out of the arm of a test, out of a
   loop and out of the code of a function, and places its binding at
   the nearest place at toplevel that it comes back through
   (FlambdaLiftFromArmsSpec.v); the validation, on the term before,
   binds such a symbol at the head of the unit, or where its [Let]
   stood. Where a symbol is bound does not matter if its binding needs
   nothing that the unit computes: [hoist_statics] binds every such
   binding first.

   What is bound first. The bindings of code, and the bindings of
   symbols whose constant has a value in the empty environment
   ([is_hoisted]): it mentions no variable, and it is not a closure at
   a function slot that its set has not got. They are taken from the
   groups of static bindings of the toplevel of the unit, in handlers
   too ([hoisted_bindings], in the order in which a run comes to
   them), and bound in one group around the unit with those bindings
   removed ([without_hoisted]). Bindings of deleted code, which bind
   nothing, and the bindings of symbols that mention a variable stay
   where they are. The code of functions and the handlers of
   recursive continuations are not looked into. This moves what
   FlambdaHoistCodeSpec.hoist_code moves, and the bindings of symbols
   besides. It does not accept every unit that that pass accepts: in
   place of that pass's check of closures it asks what is said next,
   of a unit that imports nothing, and a unit that mentions a symbol
   it imports passes there and not here.

   This is no equivalence of every unit. With its static bindings
   first a unit may be defined where it was not: where a closure is
   called before its code is bound, or a symbol is read before it is
   bound. So it is asked that every static name of the unit is in
   scope where it is mentioned, row 4 of well-formedness
   (FlambdaStaticsInScopeSpec.statics_in_scope, for a unit that
   imports nothing, with what that file asks beside it of the names of
   the unit): no state of the run then holds or looks up a symbol
   that is not bound, or a closure of code that is neither bound nor
   declared deleted (FlambdaStaticsInScopeSpec.statics_bound_in_run).
   A closure may be of code that the unit declares deleted; a call of
   it is undefined, and stays so with the bindings first, as the unit
   binds no code id that it declares deleted
   (FlambdaStaticsInScopeSpec.static_names_apart). A unit that
   passes is equivalent, run on its own, to the unit with those
   bindings first ([hoist_statics_program_equivalent_statement]): the
   two runs are in step, with the same values, and differ only in when
   a static name is bound.

   The proofs are in FlambdaHoistStaticsProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
