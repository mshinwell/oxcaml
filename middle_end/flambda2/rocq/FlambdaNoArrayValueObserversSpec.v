(* What the array value leaves as it was, of what may follow a unit.

   FlambdaObserversSpec.v says what may follow a unit by the terms that
   may be run next: an [observer] is a way out, or a handler with no
   environment of its own that meets three conditions on its text.
   [Make_immutable_array] (FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.v) is a primitive more
   that such a handler may be written with, so with it there are
   observers more. Two relations of that file are about every observer:
   [worlds_observed], of two worlds that exits leave, and
   [refines_under_observers], of two units. Of two worlds, and of two
   units, they ask what they asked and more: what the observers that
   make an array come to as well.

   Whether they relate fewer pairs than they did is not known. That an
   observer which makes an array tells apart only what some observer
   which makes none tells apart is not stated in this tree, and nor is
   the contrary. So:
   - a statement that concludes one of the two relations says more
     than it did, and gives what it gave
     ([worlds_observed_gives_free_of_arrays_statement],
     [refines_under_observers_gives_free_of_arrays_statement]);
   - a statement that has one in a premise, or one on each side of an
     equivalence, is not given back by the statement about every
     observer, whose premise asks more. There are six in
     FlambdaObserversSpec.v and FlambdaObserversActionsSpec.v: the way
     out, the composition, the two forms, and the three that say that a
     renaming keeps the relations. And a seventh has
     FlambdaSemanticsSpec.expr_refines in its premise, which is about
     every environment, those that hold an array value or keep a
     handler that makes one included.
   This file states the seven for the observers that make no array.

   The observers that make no array are a class of what a continuation
   may stand for, [observer_free_of_arrays slots], and the two
   relations of that class are those of FlambdaObserversSpec.v
   ([worlds_observed_by], [refines_observed_by]): the two relations
   with every observer that makes an array left out, and nothing else
   changed. An environment every entry of which is in the class is an
   environment of observers that is free of arrays
   ([observers_free_of_arrays_statement]), which is what a state free
   of arrays asks of its continuations
   (FlambdaNoArrayValueSpec.conts_free_of_arrays).
   [expr_refines_free_of_arrays] is [expr_refines] of the whole source
   states that are free of arrays.

   In six of the seven the worlds, the units, the static environment
   and the heap are any, as in the statement that is restated. The
   seventh, [expr_refines_free_of_arrays_under_observers_statement], is
   of a source that makes no array, from a static environment and a
   heap that are free of arrays: its premise says nothing of another
   start.

   That, of two worlds and of two units in which there is no array,
   these are the relations that there were before the array value is no
   statement of this file. A world with no array in it is more than one
   whose values hold no array value: what its symbols are bound to and
   its heap hold none either, and no code of its static environment
   makes an array (FlambdaNoArrayValueSpec.statics_no_array_value,
   [heap_no_array_value], [code_makes_no_array]); a world whose values
   hold none may keep code that makes one, which an observer may call.
   A unit with no array in it makes none, and starts from a static
   environment and a heap of that kind. What is said then rests on
   FlambdaNoArrayValueSpec.v: an observer that makes no array, applied
   to such a world, starts a state free of arrays
   ([state_free_of_arrays]), whose run is the run that there was; and
   the world that such a unit leaves is such a world
   ([cont_free_of_arrays] is of that file, and says of a handler with no
   environment that it makes no array, at any depth).

   This file is to be reviewed: the two definitions and the ten
   statements. The proofs are in FlambdaNoArrayValueObserversProofs.v,
   which needs no review. Nothing here is a premise of another file. *)
