Lemma guard_scope_cases (f : expr -> expr) (e : expr) :
  guard_scope f e = f e ∨ guard_scope f e = e.
Proof.
  unfold guard_scope. cbv zeta.
  destruct (negb (code_closed e) || scope_kept e (f e));
    [ left | right ]; reflexivity.
Qed.

Theorem guard_scope_refines : guard_scope_refines_statement.
Proof.
  intros f e Hrefines.
  destruct (guard_scope_cases f e) as [-> | ->]; [ exact Hrefines | ].
  intros vars conts statics. apply refines_refl.
Qed.

Theorem guard_scope_equivalent : guard_scope_equivalent_statement.
Proof.
  intros f e Hequivalent.
