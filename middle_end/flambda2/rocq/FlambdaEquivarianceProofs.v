(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaEquivarianceSpec.v. Nothing here
   needs review.

   The laws of the action on what a state holds are proved as those of
   [rename_expr] are in FlambdaAlphaProofs.v. [step_equivariant] goes by
   cases on the construct, through one lemma for each function that
   [step] is made of; each says that the function commutes with the
   action. The two rewrites are proved in the same way: one lemma for
   each function a rewrite is made of. *)
