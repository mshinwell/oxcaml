(* Well-kinded terms: what the machine makes undefined on account of
   kinds, and a check of the kinds that a term carries.

   This file is to be reviewed: the check ([well_kinded] and what it is
   made of, [well_kinded_unit]) against the places where the compiler
   checks kinds, listed below; what it is for a state to be well-kinded
   ([state_well_kinded]); [kind_fault]; [partial_or_over_application];
   and the statements.

   A variable of Flambda 2 has a kind ([Variable.kind]), and the terms of
   FlambdaModel.v give it where the variable is bound. Two things are
   said here about kinds, and they are to be kept apart.

   What is undefined, with no premise. A call that does not agree with
   the code it calls has no step
   ([call_at_wrong_kinds_undefined_statement];
   FlambdaSemanticsSpec.call_function makes the three tests), and a
   primitive has no value on an argument of another kind than it takes
   (FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.eval_prim_kinds_statement). These are the
   mismatches of kinds that Simplify replaces by [Invalid], and the ones
   that well-typed programs are known to produce: OxCaml accepts
   programs (for one, a match on a GADT whose index has layout [any])
   from which Simplify, having inlined, gets a call that does not agree
   with its code, in a branch that is never run. The machine has to be
   undefined there, or Simplify would be wrong on such programs. The
   request (requests/C2-kinds.md) lists the forms found.

   The check. [well_kinded] is a boolean function: under the kinds of
   the variables in scope and the kinds of the parameters of the
   continuations in scope, the kinds that the term carries agree with one
   another. It is a sufficient condition and a diagnostic. A unit that
   passes it starts in a well-kinded state, a well-kinded state steps to
   a well-kinded state, and a well-kinded state is never undefined for
   one of the reasons of [kind_fault]; in such a run a variable holds a
   value of the kind its binder gave it. It is not a condition that the
   terms of the compiler are known to meet, and no statement about those
   terms may take it as a premise:
   - each of its conditions is one that the compiler checks where it
     visits the node, and stops on. It does not visit everything: a
     [Switch] on a constant, whose arm that is not taken applies a
     continuation to an argument of another kind than its parameter,
     compiles, since Simplify removes the arm before it looks at it, and
     fails the check here, which looks at every branch;
   - that what closure conversion builds passes it is known by
     experiment only: in the programs tried, a well-typed program gives
     a mismatch at a call, or in what a load reads, and never where a
     variable is bound (the request, as above).
   So it is not proposed as a condition of
   FlambdaWellFormedSpec.well_formed_unit. The test tool prints what it
   answers for the unit before Simplify and for the unit after, and goes
   on whatever the answer.

   What it checks:
   - every variable and every continuation used is in scope;
   - the kind a [Let] gives its variable is that of its defining
     expression ([kind_of_named]; the compiler's
     [Typing_env.add_variable_definition] fails otherwise). That of a
     primitive application is the kind of the primitive's result
     (FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.prim_result_kind), whatever its arguments;
   - the arguments of an [Apply_cont] have the kinds of the parameters of
     its continuation, in number and in order (the compiler fails
     otherwise: [Continuation_uses_env.add_continuation_use],
     [Continuation_uses.add_use]);
   - the scrutinee of a [Switch] is a naked immediate;
   - the return continuation of an [Apply] takes parameters of the kinds
     of the return arity the call is made at, unarized, and its exception
     continuation takes one argument of kind [Value] followed by the
     extra arguments of the call, each of which is of the kind it is
     given with;
   - a handler has as many kinds as parameters and its parameters are
     distinct ([Bound_parameters.create]), as are the parameters of code
     and its [my_closure] ([Bound_for_function.create]);
   - the body of code is well-kinded on its own: under its parameters,
     whose kinds are those of its parameter arity, unarized, and
     [my_closure], which has kind [Value], with its return continuation
     at its result arity, unarized, and its exception continuation at one
     [Value];
   - a value slot holds, where a closure is made (by a [Let] or
     statically, of a set of one function or of several), a [Simple] of
     the kind of the slot, and a variable bound to its projection has
     that kind. The compiler's value slots have their kinds
     ([Value_slot.kind]); here the kinds are a table given to the check
     ([slot_kinds]);
   - a variable bound to a closure, or to the projection of a function
     slot, has kind [Value];
   - the fields of a static block have kind [Value] (the blocks of this
     fragment are blocks of values; the compiler checks a field against
     the kind that the shape of the block gives it) and the contents of
     a static boxed number are a number of a kind that can be boxed.

   What it does not look at, each being undefined where it is executed:
   - the kinds of the arguments of a primitive
     ([Simplify_primitive.arg_kind_mismatch] gives [Invalid]; a
     primitive has no value on such arguments);
   - the kind of the callee of an [Apply] ([Provers.wrong_kind] answers
     "invalid", and the call becomes [Invalid]), and of what a value slot
     or a function slot is projected from (in the compiler a primitive,
     so as above). What is not a closure can be neither called nor
     projected from. Nor does it look at the function slot that a
     projection names (FlambdaValueSpec.project_value_slot,
     [project_function_slot]);
   - whether a call is made at the arities of the code called, even where
     the code is named, and whether its arguments are of the kinds of the
     arity it is made at: the three tests of
     FlambdaSemanticsSpec.call_function.

   What else it does not check:
   - that symbols and code ids are in scope: a symbol is a value whether
     or not it is bound, and deleted code is in scope and not bound;
   - that a bound name is not already in scope (Simplify's freshness);
   - where static bindings are: that is FlambdaWellFormedSpec.v.

   The dynamic counterpart. Every value has a kind
   (FlambdaValueSpec.kind_of_value). A state is well-kinded
   ([state_well_kinded], a boolean function too) when its expression is
   well-kinded under the kinds of the values of its variables
   ([kinds_of_env]) and the kinds of the parameters of what its
   continuations stand for ([arities_of_conts]), and everything it holds
   is well-kinded: the values, down the value slots of closures and the
   fields of blocks; the handlers of continuation closures, under the
   environments they keep; the code and the statically allocated values
   of the static environment. A continuation that is a way out of the
   term has the parameters given by [outer], which is the interface of
   the term: for a unit, its return and exception continuations, each
   taking one [Value] ([unit_arities]). The kinds are those of the values
   held now: the predicate does not remember what a binder said. What it
   gives for a binder is in the step: a well-kinded state that binds a
   variable binds a value of the kind the binder gives.

   The statements:
   - a call that does not agree with the code called is undefined,
     whatever the state ([call_at_wrong_kinds_undefined_statement]);
   - a call that the compiler takes for a partial application or an
     over-application is undefined too, and should not be: see below
     ([partial_or_over_application_undefined_statement]);
   - a unit that passes the check starts in a well-kinded state
     ([well_kinded_unit_state_statement]);
   - a well-kinded state steps to a well-kinded state
     ([step_well_kinded_statement], [run_well_kinded_statement]);
   - a well-kinded state is not undefined for a reason that the check
     rules out ([well_kinded_no_kind_fault_statement]): [kind_fault] is
     those reasons, as a test on a state. It reads no unbound variable;
     it applies no handler to the wrong number of arguments; its
     [Switch] is on a value of kind naked immediate;
   - a well-kinded state exits only through a continuation of [outer],
     with values of the kinds of its parameters
     ([well_kinded_exit_statement]);
   - the three together for a unit run on its own
     ([well_kinded_unit_never_faults_statement],
     [well_kinded_unit_exits_statement]).

   What a well-kinded state may still do that is undefined: reach
   [Invalid]; apply a primitive that has no value, as it has none on
   arguments of the wrong kinds; [Switch] on a value with no arm, or on
   a poison constant (which has the kind it is given); call what is not
   a closure, a closure whose code is not bound, directly a closure of
   other code than the one named, a closure of code with which the call
   does not agree, or code whose body binds something static; project a
   value slot from what is not a closure with that slot; bind a static
   name twice, or a recursive handler that binds something static. The
   last three are what FlambdaWellFormedSpec.v rules out for a unit.

   Partial applications and over-applications are left out of the
   fragment (FlambdaModel.v). A call with fewer or more arguments than
   the code has parameters is undefined on the machine. For some such
   calls that is right: Simplify makes them [Invalid] too, and well-typed
   programs produce them in branches that are never run. For the others
   it is an omission: the compiler takes the call for a partial
   application, or for an over-application, and gives it a meaning, and
   every statement about a unit that executes one says nothing.
   [partial_or_over_application] is the test of arities by which the
   compiler tells which is which (simplify/simplify_apply_expr.ml,
   [simplify_direct_function_call]); it is not all that the compiler
   asks of such a call, and the comment there says what else.
   [at_partial_or_over_application] is the test on a state, where the
   kinds of the arguments are known too. The test tool refuses a unit
   with a direct call that passes the test of arities; a run that stops
   at a call that passes the test on a state it reports as such, and
   then neither compares the two runs nor attempts the validation.

   Tupled functions are left out too. A call of unknown arity gives a
   tupled function one argument, the tuple, whatever the arity of its
   code ([Code_metadata.is_tupled]; [simplify_direct_tuple_application]
   turns such a call into a direct one of the code, on the fields); a
   direct call and a call of known arity go by the arity of the code.
   The code of this fragment has no such mark, and its [Indirect] is
   both sorts of indirect call. So the call with the tuple would be
   undefined here, or taken for a partial application, or, where the
   code has one parameter, run with the parameter bound to the tuple
   and not to its field, which is a wrong result and not an undefined
   one. The test tool refuses code that is tupled.

   The primitives. The check takes the kind of the result of a primitive
   from FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.prim_result_kind, and the proofs use two of
   the laws there: a primitive that has a value has one of its result
   kind ([eval_prim_kinds_statement]), and a primitive makes its value
   out of its arguments ([eval_prim_preserves_statement]).

   The proofs are in FlambdaWellKindedProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
