(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaCompareAlphaSpec.v. Nothing here
   needs review.

   Symmetry: the comparison of two terms under pairs of names is that of
   the terms the other way round under the pairs turned round ([flip]).
   Transitivity: two comparisons compose, under maps of names that
   compose ([composes]: a property of what the maps match, kept when a
   pair is put on each). A context keeps what the comparison accepts
   ([plug_eqb]); the rules that rename a binder are accepted
   (FlambdaNominalProofs.v). *)
