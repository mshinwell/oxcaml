(* FlambdaGiveScrutineeSpec.give_scrutinees commutes with renaming and
   keeps scope: the lemmas from which
   FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceProofs.v and FlambdaStaticsScopeProofs.v
   prove the two statements. There is no statement here, and nothing
   here needs review.

   The pass compares names by equality only and makes none, so each of
   its functions gives, on a renamed term, the renamed result. For the
   scope: the rewrite puts the variable for a constant only where
   something is known of it, and something is known in an arm of a
   [Switch] on the variable, or in a handler bound beside such a
   [Switch], or under those with no binder of the variable between:
   the variable is free in the term. The continuations and the code
   are as they were. *)
