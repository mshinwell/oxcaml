(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaLiftSpec.v. Nothing here needs
   review.

   The term and the term lifted are run side by side. Where the first
   executes a [Let] that is lifted, the second executes the [Let_static]
   and then the [Let] of the symbol, two steps for one; everywhere else
   they step together. So the simulation is one in which each step of
   the first run is answered by one or more of the second
   (FlambdaSimulationProofs.stuttering_refines). The relation between the
   two states
   ([state_lifted]) is that the second expression is the first lifted,
   the values of the second are those of the first up to
   [value_lifted], and so are what the symbols are bound to
   ([statics_lifted]). The machine cannot tell such values apart: every
   observation answers alike ([closure_of_lifted], ...), and so does
   every primitive (FlambdaPrimitiveProofs.eval_prim_related).

   What keeps a new static binding from failing where the [Let] did not
   is that the second run is that of a well-formed unit, which never
   binds a name twice (FlambdaWellFormedProofs.well_formed_never_faults).

   A call of code in which [my_closure] is bound to a symbol is also two
   steps for one, and the closure called must then be that symbol. A
   call may call the callee of an [Apply], a value that another call
   returned (what is left of an over-application calls it) or the
   closure that a partial application keeps. So the simulation has, of
   the second run, the invariant of FlambdaMyClosureProofs.v
   ([known_state_ok]): no value of it is a closure of that code but the
   symbol. A call is gone through by its shape ([shape_lifted]): the
   two runs make a full call, an over-application or a partial
   application together.

   That the values at the exit are equal, and not only lifted, is from
   an invariant of the first run alone ([plain_state]): the
   continuations in scope never stand for a way out ([cont_closed]),
   so a value that is not a constant or a symbol, a partial application
   included, is given to a handler. *)
