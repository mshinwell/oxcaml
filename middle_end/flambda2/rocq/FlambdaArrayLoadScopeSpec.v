(* The reading of a known immutable array keeps scope.

   This file is to be reviewed: the statement, against
   FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceSpec.keeps_scope and
   FlambdaArrayLoadSpec.load_known_arrays.

   The proof that the validator answers the same of renamed terms goes
   rewrite by rewrite, and uses of each that it keeps scope: on a term
   whose code is closed the code of the result is closed, and no
   variable or continuation is free in the result that is not free in
   the term. The pass replaces a primitive by a constant, or by what an
   element of an array holds: a symbol, a constant, or a variable that
   is an argument of the [Let] that made the array, or of the static
   constant of its symbol, and that no binder has bound again since.
   So it keeps scope.

   The statement is in a file of its own, and not in
   FlambdaArrayLoadSpec.v, because [keeps_scope] is defined after the
   validator, which applies the rewrite.

   The proof is in FlambdaArrayLoadScopeProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
