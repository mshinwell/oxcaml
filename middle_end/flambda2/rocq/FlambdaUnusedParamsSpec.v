(* Removing the parameters of a continuation that its handler does not
   use: a normalisation that refines.

   This file is to be reviewed: [drop_unused_params] and what it is made
   of, which are extracted and run by the validation of
   middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/, and the statement.

   Simplify removes a parameter of a continuation that the handler, as
   rebuilt, does not use, and with it the argument at every application
   (simplify/simplify_let_cont_expr.ml: [decide_param_usage_non_recursive]
   asks the free names of the rebuilt handler, and
   [Apply_cont_rewrite.create] records the answer for each parameter;
   simplify/apply_cont_rewrite.ml, [make_rewrite], drops the arguments
   of the parameters that are [Unused] where simplify/expr_builder.ml
   rebuilds an [Apply_cont]). The front end makes such parameters all
   the time: the continuation after a [while] or a [for] loop takes the
   unit that the loop returns and every variable the loop assigns, and
   uses at most the latter.

   [drop_unused_params] does it for the continuations of a term. Going
   down the term it keeps, for each continuation in scope, which of its
   parameters are kept ([masks]): [None] for all of them, or one boolean
   for each. At a non-recursive [Let_cont] the handler is done first; the
   parameters that are then not free in it
   (FlambdaNormaliseSpec.var_free_b) are removed from the handler, with
   their kinds in its metadata ([keep_kinds]), and
   in the body of the [Let_cont] the arguments at their positions are
   removed from every [Apply_cont] and every arm of a [Switch] that
   applies the continuation ([drop_args]), wherever it is: in the
   handlers of other continuations and in those of recursive ones, so in
   a loop that exits through the continuation. At a recursive [Let_cont]
   the parameters removed from a handler are those that are not free in
   it as it stands, before anything is removed from it
   ([used_params_in_loop]); their arguments are removed from the
   applications in the handlers of the [Let_cont], which are then done,
   and in its body.

   What stops it:
   - a continuation that some [Apply] of the body has as its return or
     exception continuation keeps all its parameters ([returned_to]): the
     call passes it as it is. Simplify puts a wrapper continuation
     around such a call (simplify/expr_builder.ml, [New_wrapper]), or
     removes the extra arguments of its exception continuation; this
     pass has no fresh names to make a wrapper with, and leaves both;
   - the first parameter of an exception handler, which is the
     exception, is kept whether it is used or not, as Simplify keeps it
     ([decide_param_usage_non_recursive], its [exn_bucket]). The other
     parameters of an exception handler that only raises reach (an
     [Apply_cont] with a trap action is one) go as those of any
     continuation; the trap action of an application stays as it is;
   - a parameter of a recursive continuation that its handler uses only
     to pass it on, to itself or to another continuation whose handler
     does not use it, is kept. Simplify finds those too, by its data flow
     analysis ([decide_param_usage_recursive]), which this pass has not
     got. A parameter that the handler binds again at once, as
     FlambdaParamAliasesSpec.bind_aliased_params makes it do where every
     application gives the parameter the same thing, is one that the
     handler does not use;
   - the bodies of code are not gone into
     (FlambdaNormaliseSpec.rewrite_code takes the pass there).

   The result refines the term ([drop_unused_params_refines_statement]),
   under all environments. It is not equivalent to it: an argument that
   is removed is no longer evaluated, so a term that was undefined for a
   variable with no value there may become defined. So the pass is for
   the term before Simplify.

   What is checked and what is not: nothing is asked of the names of
   the term, and nothing of the arities. Where an application has not as
   many arguments as the continuation has parameters, the arguments are
   cut as the mask says and the application, which was undefined, may
   become defined. Where a parameter is bound twice in one handler, both
   are kept or both removed, as [var_free_b] answers of the name.
   [returned_to] and [var_free_b] may say yes when the answer is no,
   never the reverse.

   Renaming: the functions here compare names by equality only and bind
   none, so the pass commutes with a renaming. That statement is owed to
   the nominal work and is not made here.

   The proofs are in FlambdaUnusedParamsProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
