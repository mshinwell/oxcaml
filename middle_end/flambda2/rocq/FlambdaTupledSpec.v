(* Tupled functions: what a call of code that the compiler marks as
   tupled comes to.

   This file is to be reviewed: the statements, against
   FlambdaSemanticsSpec.tuple_fields, [detuple], [arguments_for_code]
   and [shape_of_closure_call], which they restate, and against what
   the compiler does with a tupled function
   (simplify/simplify_apply_expr.ml,
   [simplify_direct_tuple_application]; at run time [caml_tuplifyN],
   backend/cmm_helpers.ml, [tuplify_function]).

   A function of the source that takes a tuple, [fun (x, y) -> e], is
   compiled to code with a parameter for each component, marked as
   tupled ([Code_metadata.is_tupled]). A caller that does not know the
   code gives the closure one argument, the tuple, and the entry point
   of the closure takes the tuple apart; where Simplify knows the code,
   it makes the projections itself and calls the code with the
   components. In the model every call of the fragment gives tupled
   code the tuple, and the machine takes it apart, with the projections
   that Simplify makes.

   - The fields that the machine reads of a tuple of a given size are
     those of an immutable block of tag 0 that has exactly that many
     fields, all of kind [Value]: the tuple is that block, or a symbol
     bound to it ([tuple_is_block_statement]).
   - A call that gives tupled code one argument, a tuple with a field
     for each parameter, is the full call of the code with the fields
     ([apply_tupled_statement]).
   - A call that gives it more arguments is that full call, at the
     result arity of the code, returning to what is left of the
     application: an over-application, whose first argument is the
     tuple ([apply_tupled_over_statement]).
   - A call of tupled code is undefined where it has no argument, where
     the first parameter of its arity is not one [Value], or where its
     first argument is not such a tuple
     ([apply_tupled_undefined_statement]); and it is never a partial
     application ([tupled_never_partial_statement]).
   - Three units run as they should: tupled code given a tuple that is
     a symbol, given one that a primitive makes, and given a tuple and
     one more argument. They are well-formed, and pass the check of
     kinds ([examples_run_statement],
     [examples_well_formed_statement]). Given a triple, or a block of
     another tag, in place of the pair, the call is undefined
     ([wrong_tuple_undefined_statement]).

   The statements about calls suppose that the parameters of the code
   are single values, as many as it has variables for them: so are
   those of the compiler's tupled code, each the component of a tuple.

   - A direct call that gives tupled code a tuple is refined by the body
     of the code with its parameters bound to the fields of the tuple,
     each by the projection that Simplify makes
     ([inline_tupled_statement]), and the two are equivalent where the
     callee is a closure of that code and the call returns at the result
     arity of the code ([inline_tupled_equivalent_statement]).
     FlambdaApplySpec.inlinable excludes tupled code, as its bindings
     are of the parameters to the arguments; these are the bindings for
     tupled code. The validation inlines such a call
     (FlambdaNormaliseSpec.inline_apply, by [inlined_tupled_call]).

   What is not here: the direct call of tupled code as the compiler has
   it, which gives the code the components (the review comment at
   FlambdaSemanticsSpec.shape_of_closure_call), and so the statement
   that such a call is the call with the tuple; and the inlining of a
   call that gives tupled code a tuple and more arguments.

   The proofs are in FlambdaTupledProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
