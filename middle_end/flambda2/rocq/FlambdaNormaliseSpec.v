(* Normalising a term by rewrites that are proved: the first of them,
   inlining direct calls of known code.

   This file is to be reviewed: the functions, which are extracted and run
   by the validation of middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/, and the
   statement.

   The validation compares the term before Simplify with the term after
   (FlambdaCompareSpec.v). They are seldom the same as they stand, so each
   is first brought to a normal form by rewrites whose correctness is a
   theorem; what the comparison then accepts is correct by those theorems
   and the soundness of the comparison. The rewrites applied to the term
   before may be refinements; those applied to the term after must be
   equivalences, as the chain runs from the one to the other.

   [inline_calls] is for the term before. It goes down the term, into the
   handlers of continuations and the bodies of code too, keeping the code
   that the [Let_static]s passed have bound ([known]), and replaces a
   direct call of known code by the code inlined
   (FlambdaApplySpec.inlined_body) where that is sound ([inlinable_b],
   which decides FlambdaApplySpec.inlinable). What is known where a
   handler or code is defined holds where it runs, however much later: a
   code id is bound once (FlambdaWellFormedSpec.v). The body of code is
   rewritten with what was known before its group of bindings, so nothing
   is inlined into itself; and what a group makes known is its code as
   rewritten. A call of code whose id is among those given ([kept]) is
   left as it is. The caller chooses them, and they are not trusted:
   leaving a call is always sound. They are there for the code that
   Simplify does not inline, recursive functions above all: a call of
   one, inlined, leaves a call of the same code to inline in the next
   round, and so on for as many rounds as there are, where Simplify
   leaves the first call alone.

   [expr_in_scope] is the check that code is closed. It is a sufficient
   condition, by its soundness (in the Proofs file); nothing is claimed
   where it answers no.

   [inline_tail_conts], for the term before, puts the handler of a
   non-recursive continuation where the continuation is applied, when that
   is at the end of a run of [Let]s that is the body of its [Let_cont]:
   the continuation is then applied exactly once. The parameters become
   [Let]s. It is what inlining a call leaves to be done, the continuation
   of the call being applied at the end of the inlined body.

   [drop_deleted_code], for either term, removes the bindings of deleted
   code, which bind nothing, and a [Let_static] left with no binding.

   [remove_unused_total_lets], for either term, is the part of
   [remove_unused_lets] that is an equivalence: it removes an unused [Let]
   only where the defining expression is a constant or a symbol, which
   always has a value, and that value is of the kind of the [Let]. A
   [Let] has no step where the value is of another kind
   (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.step), so removing one that does not pass the
   test would give a meaning to a term that has none.

   [remove_unused_defined_lets] goes further, also as an equivalence: it
   keeps the variables in scope as it goes, each with the kind of its
   binder (of the [Let], or of the handler for a parameter), and removes
   an unused [Let] whose defining expression is a [Simple] or a closure
   made of constants, symbols and variables in scope, which has a value
   where those variables are bound, and that value is of the kind of the
   [Let]. For a variable that is known from its binder: the machine binds
   a variable only to a value of the kind of its binder.

   [inline_known_calls] is inlining as an equivalence, for either term:
   it inlines a direct call only where the callee is a symbol that a
   [Let_static] passed has bound to a closure of the code called, so that
   the call cannot be undefined for being of something else; and only
   where the arities of the call are those of the code as
   FlambdaSemanticsSpec.call_function asks ([call_agrees_b]), so that it
   cannot be undefined for that either. The kinds of the values of the
   arguments are not asked for: the call tests them, and so does the
   inlined body, where each parameter is bound by a [Let] at its kind.
   For the two to test the same, the code must give as many kinds as it
   has parameters. It goes where [inline_calls] goes, and leaves the
   same calls alone.

   [merge_statics], for either term, makes one group of [Let_static]s that
   follow one another, and puts the code of a group before its symbols.
   Neither changes the static environment that results, so groups that
   differ only in how they are cut up and ordered become the same.

   [collapse_switches], for the term before, replaces a [Switch] whose
   arms are all the same by that arm. It is a refinement only: the
   [Switch] is undefined where its scrutinee has no arm.

   [fold_constants], for either term, replaces a primitive applied to
   constants by its value, when that is a constant, and a [Switch] on a
   constant by its arm. The value of the primitive is what
   FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.eval_prim says, which the semantics uses too. It
   is asked under the empty static environment: on constants a primitive
   does not look at it.

   [remove_unused_lets], also for the term before, removes each [Let] whose
   variable is not free in its body, in bodies and in the handlers of
   non-recursive continuations. [var_free_b] is the test; it may say that
   a variable is free when it is not, never the reverse.

   The proofs are in FlambdaNormaliseProofs.v, which needs no review. *)

(* Where the body of a [Let_cont] is a [Switch], and the handler takes no

   that applies the continuation may go at once where the arm of the
   handler for the same value goes: the handler runs under the variables
   of the [Let_cont], so the scrutinee has the same value in it. The arm
   of the handler must not name the continuation being bound, which in
   the handler is another one: neither as the continuation that it
   applies nor in its trap action. An arm of the body that has a trap
   action stays as it is. The [Let_cont] goes if no arm names its
   continuation any more. Simplify does as much from what an arm tells
   it of the scrutinee. The handler must give no kinds of parameters
   either: one that has no parameters and gives a kind never runs
   (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.apply_cont_value), and an arm that applies it
   is undefined. *)
(* CR mshinwell: an arm of the handler whose trap action names [k] is
   left where it is. Until this was repaired only the continuation that
   the arm applies was compared with [k], so an arm of the handler that
   installed or removed an outer exception handler of the name [k] was
   taken into the body, where [k] is the continuation being bound: its
   trap action was captured. The machine of FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v has
   no stack of handlers and does not read a trap action, so
   [thread_switches_equivalent_statement] held of the rewrite as it
   was; it says nothing of the machine of FlambdaTrapSpec.v, which has
