(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaFreshBindersSpec.v. Nothing here
   needs review.

   The free names of an expression whose code is closed are a list
   (FlambdaFreeNamesSpec.v), so a name outside the list is not free. The
   statements that open a binder are those of FlambdaNominalSpec.v at a
   swap. A rule that compares two binders at one name is two uses of the
   rule of [alpha_equivalent] for that binder, at the two swaps, with the
   rule for a context between them. *)
