(* The two passes that unbox the parameters of continuations, and the
   names of a term: that they commute with renaming, and that they
   keep scope. Nothing here needs review.

   The statements are those of FlambdaUnboxParamsRenameSpec.v and of
   FlambdaUnboxVariantsRenameSpec.v, whose Proofs files take them from
   here. They are proved in this file because the validation runs one
   of the passes: FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceProofs.v and
   FlambdaValidateScopeProofs.v need what is proved here for the round
   of FlambdaValidateSpec.v, so this file imports neither. What the
   proofs of renaming use of the first of them, the equations for what
   is known of blocks and of wrapped numbers and three more, is taken
   as premises in the section below, under the names that file gives
   them; the two Proofs files, and that file where it uses the result,
   give the premises. *)
