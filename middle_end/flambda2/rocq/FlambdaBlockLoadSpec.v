(* Loading a field of a block that is known: a normalisation that
   refines.

   This file is to be reviewed: [load_known_blocks] and what it is made
   of, which are extracted and run by the validation of
   middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/, and the statement.

   Simplify replaces the load of a field of a block that it knows by what
   the field holds
   ([Simplify_unary_primitive.simplify_immutable_block_load]), from the
   type of the block; likewise [Is_int] and [Get_tag] of one by their
   answers. Every unit made from an OCaml source ends that way: the
   fields of the module are loaded from the block that the body of the
   module made, to make the static block of the unit. And a function
   inlined where its argument is a constructor applied leaves the match
   on that constructor to be resolved. There are no types of blocks in
   the model yet, so [load_known_blocks] does it for the two cases in
   which a block is known from the term alone. It goes through a term
   keeping ([known_blocks]):

   - for a variable bound by a [Let] to a [Make_block], the tag and the
     arguments of the [Make_block] ([block_made]). The model's
     [Make_block] is the immutable one of values only
     (FlambdaPrimitiveModel.v); a block that is mutable, or of another
     shape, is not converted to it, so nothing is ever known of one;
   - for a symbol bound by a [Let_static] to a [Static_const_block], its
     tag and its fields ([static_block_made]). That too is immutable.

   The two are read alike, through FlambdaValueSpec.block_of, by the
   primitives and by the proof.

   A [Let] of a primitive applied to such a variable or symbol becomes a
   [Let] of a [Simple] ([load_known_named], [of_known_block]):

   - [Is_int], with [variant_only] or without, becomes the naked
     immediate 0;
   - [Get_tag] becomes the tag, a naked immediate;
   - [Block_load kind field] becomes what the field holds, under these
     conditions ([field_loaded]), and is left as it is under any other:
     the access kind says of the tag and of the size what is known of
     the block, where it says anything ([known_is]); the block has the
     field; and the field kind of the access is [Any_value]. A load
     whose field kind is [Immediate] is left alone: it has no value on a
     field that is not a tagged immediate, and that is not known from
     the term.

   So where the access kind disagrees with the block the pass does not
   fire, although the load is then undefined
   (FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.eval_block_load) and anything would refine it.

   Nothing else is rewritten. The [Let] stays, as with
   ../types/rocq/FlambdaAliasesSpec.follow_aliases: the variable is then
   an alias of the field, which that pass follows, and the [Make_block]
   is removed if it is then unused.

   Going under a binder, what is known of its name is forgotten, and so
   is what any field that is that name holds ([forget_var]): the name
   stands for something else from there on. What the other fields of
   such a block hold stays known, and so do its tag and its size: a
   function inlined twice binds the same names twice, and the block made
   by the first copy is read in the second. So nothing is asked of the
   names of the term. A handler of a non-recursive continuation is gone
   into, with what is known where it is defined; the handlers of
   recursive ones and the bodies of code are left as they are
   (FlambdaNormaliseSpec.rewrite_code takes the pass into code, with
   nothing known there).

   The result refines the term ([load_known_blocks_refines_statement]).
   It is not claimed to be equivalent to it: a static block may hold a
   field that is not of kind [Value], the load of which is undefined
   where the field itself is not. So the pass is for the term before
   Simplify.

   The proofs are in FlambdaBlockLoadProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
