(* Proofs for FlambdaLiftFromCodeSpec.v. Nothing here needs review.

   The two runs are in step. The second expression is the first with
   its [Let]s lifted out and its groups of static bindings rewritten;
   values are related by FlambdaLiftSpec.value_lifted, as for the
   lifting at toplevel, and the lemmas of FlambdaLiftProofs.v about the
   observations of such values are used as they are. The second static
   environment has the code of the first, rewritten, and binds every
   symbol that the first binds to the same thing, lifted
   ([statics_lifted_out]); and it has, for the code that the first has
   bound, what the [Let]s lifted out of it need ([aliases_bound]): each
   symbol given is bound to what its [Let] makes, whenever the [Let] is
   executed. That is so from the group that binds the code on, as the
   bindings of the symbols are in that group; and a defining expression
   that mentions no variable is evaluated alike in every environment.

   The bindings are put once each. What a [Let] needs is that the
   bindings that stand for it are evaluated ([bindings_bound],
   [bound_alias]), whichever [Let] they were put for: a binding that
   is left out is the same as one that is put
   ([once_each_has]). The handlers of a group of recursive
   continuations are rewritten each at its path, and a closure of
   one of them carries the group rewritten, with what the [Let]s
   lifted out of its handlers need ([cont_lifted_out]).

   The second run is that of a well-formed unit, so it never binds a
   symbol twice (FlambdaWellFormedProofs.well_formed_never_faults).
   That the values at the exit are equal is from the invariant of the
   first run that FlambdaLiftProofs.v has for the check of the exits
   ([plain_state]).

   The two runs may start from a continuation environment of what may
   follow a unit (FlambdaObserversSpec.observers), the empty one for
   the statements of FlambdaLiftFromCodeSpec.v: what may follow a unit
   binds nothing static, so the rewrite leaves it as it is
   ([observer_lifted_out]). Without the test of the exits, the values
   of two exits that answer each other are lifted
   ([unit_lifted_out_observed], for FlambdaLiftObservedSpec.v). *)
