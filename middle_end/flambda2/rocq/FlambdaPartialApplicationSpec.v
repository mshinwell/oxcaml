(* Partial applications and over-applications: what a call comes to
   that does not give a function as many arguments as its code has
   parameters.

   This file is to be reviewed: the statements, against
   FlambdaSemanticsSpec.shape_of_closure_call, [shape_of_call] and
   [apply_cont_value], which they restate as steps, and against what the
   compiler does with such calls (simplify/simplify_apply_expr.ml,
   [simplify_direct_partial_application] and
   [simplify_direct_over_application]; at run time, [caml_applyN] and
   [caml_curryN]).

   - A call that gives a closure fewer arguments than its code has
     parameters calls nothing: it gives its return continuation a
     partial application, the value that keeps the closure and the
     arguments ([apply_partial_statement]).
   - An indirect call of a partial application, with one argument at
     least and arguments of the kinds of its arity, is the call of the
     closure that it keeps with the arguments that it keeps followed by
     those of the call ([apply_partial_application_statement]). A
     direct call of one, and a call that gives it no argument, are
     undefined ([apply_partial_application_undefined_statement]). So is
     a call whose own arguments are not of the kinds of its own arity,
     whatever the partial application keeps
     ([apply_partial_application_kinds_statement]): the test is not
     left to the call of the closure, which looks at the arguments kept
     and the new ones together, where a partial application that no
     call made could hide the mismatch
     ([malformed_partial_application_statement] is an example).
   - So a partial application whose result is at once called with more
     arguments refines the one call with all the arguments
     ([partial_then_apply_statement]). It is a refinement and not an
     equivalence because the first call is undefined where the
     compiler's test of arities fails for it, or its arguments are not
     of the kinds of its arity, and the one call need not be.
   - A call that gives a closure more arguments than its code has
     parameters is a full call with the first of them, at the result
     arity of the code, that returns to what is left of the application
     ([apply_over_statement]); and what is left, applied to the one
     value that the full call returns, is an indirect call of that value
     with the arguments that remain
     ([over_application_applied_statement]).
   - So an over-application is refined by the full call followed, in a
     continuation, by the call of its result with the arguments that
     remain ([over_application_split_statement]): the term that Simplify
     makes of an over-application of a function it knows
     ([Simplify_common.split_direct_over_application]), but for the
     regions that it opens around the two calls when the function may
     allocate locally, which the fragment has not got. The two runs are
     not step for step the same: where the machine applies what is left
     of the application, the term applies a handler, which takes one
     step more.
   - Two units run as they should, one with a partial application that
     is then applied and one with an over-application; they are
     well-formed, and pass the check of kinds
     ([examples_run_statement], [examples_well_formed_statement]).

   Exceptions. A call evaluates the extra arguments of its exception
   continuation whatever it turns out to be, so each statement about a
   step supposes that they have values. A partial application raises
   nothing. The full call inside an over-application and the call of
   its result raise to the one exception continuation of the
   over-application, with its extra arguments: what is left of the
   application keeps that continuation with the values of the extra
   arguments ([apply_over_statement]), and the term that splits an
   over-application gives the two calls the same exception continuation
   and the same extra arguments. Two units show it, one that raises in
   the full call and one that raises in the call of its result
   ([over_raises_statement]). A call whose extra arguments have no value
   is undefined even where it would make a partial application and not
   use them ([apply_extra_undefined_statement]). The machine does not
   execute trap actions, so no statement here depends on one.

   The proofs are in FlambdaPartialApplicationProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
