(* Proofs for FlambdaGiveScrutineeSpec.v. This file needs no review: what
   is to be reviewed is the statement there.

   [give_scrutinee x k i] changes an argument only where the variable
   holds the constant that the argument is, so the two runs are in
   step and pass the same values: a bisimulation, in which the term
   and the result are run under the same variables, and a continuation
   stands in the second run for the closure of the handler rewritten.
   What is known of [x] where an expression is holds of the variables
   that it runs under ([holds]).

   Some closures are not so: that of a continuation whose handler is
   rewritten for the number of the arm that applies it (arm_fact),
   when [x] is not that number. It is in scope in the [Let_cont]s
   between its own and the [Switch], whose handlers do not mention
   it, in the [Switch], and in the arm that the [Switch] takes; the
   arm taken has another number, so does not apply it. The relation
   of states has the list of such continuations ([dead]), and asks
   that two continuations be related only where the expression may
   apply them and they are not in the list; a closure asks the same
   of the continuations that its handler, or a handler bound with
   it, mentions ([closure_mentions]), so one made while such a
   continuation is in scope is related to its counterpart. The arm
   taken has its own case ([Rel_state_arm]), which asks only of the
   continuation that it applies. *)
