(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaRunUnderSpec.v. Nothing here needs
   review.

   The two runs are related step by step. Their states are the same but
   for their continuation environments, and what a free continuation of
   the term stands for in the one is [under] what it stands for in the
   other: a way out, and what [base] binds it to; two closures of one
   handler whose environments are so related at the continuations that
   the handler and its group leave free; or the same with extra
   arguments, or with what is left of an over-application. The relation
   is asked only at the free continuations, so that the body of closed
   code, which is run under the two continuations of the call, is
   related to itself whatever [base] binds. *)
