(* A parameter of a continuation that every application gives one
   variable, which is at the handler what it is at the applications, is
   that variable: a normalisation that is an equivalence.

   This file is to be reviewed: [unalias_params] and what it is made
   of, and the statement. Nothing applies the pass yet. It is written
   for the validation of middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/ to apply
   to each of the two terms that it compares, once it has placed their
   continuations (FlambdaValidateSpec.placed).

   Simplify gives a continuation a parameter for a primitive that has
   been computed on every path to it
   (simplify/common_subexpression_elimination.ml, [join], which
   simplify/join_points.ml calls). Where the results are not held by
   one variable that is in scope where the continuation is defined
   ([join_one_cse_equation]: every case but [Rhs_in_scope]), the
   continuation has a new parameter, each application has for it the
   variable that holds the result on its path, and the handler is
   simplified knowing that the parameter is the result: an application
   of the primitive there becomes the parameter. The term before
   Simplify has no such parameter and computes the primitive again in
   the handler. A continuation with one application is a case of this:
   the primitive is computed between the [Let_cont] and the
   application, as for the test of the bounds of a string and the
   read that follows it.

   Once the continuations are placed, the [Let_cont] of such a
   continuation is under the [Let] that computes the primitive, and
   the variable given for the parameter is in scope at the handler.
   [unalias_params] then takes the parameter away: the applications
   lose the argument ([drop_arg]), the handler loses the parameter and
   begins with a [Let] of the parameter to that variable, with the
   kind that the handler had for the parameter ([unalias_param]).
   What follows aliases and removes a [Let] that is not used does the
   rest, and FlambdaCseSpec.share_known_primitives, on the term
   before, makes the second computation of the primitive a [Let] of
   the variable that holds the first.

   FlambdaParamAliasesSpec.bind_aliased_params with
   FlambdaDeadParamsSpec.drop_dead_params, which the rounds of the
   term before apply, do as much for a parameter that is always given
   one thing, and more: they take constants and symbols, and the
   parameters of a loop. Each is stated as a refinement, and the
   second is no more than that: the machine tests the kind of a value
   where a handler is applied, and the parameters that it removes go
   with their tests. A rewrite of the term after Simplify has to be
   refined by the term that it rewrites, so those two are for the term
   before only. [unalias_params] keeps the test, in the [Let], where
   the machine tests the kind in the same way; so it is an
   equivalence, and may be applied to either term. It also asks less
   of the variable: that no binder on the way from the [Let_cont] to
   an application binds it, where [bind_aliased_params] asks that
   nothing in the scope of the continuation binds it.

   A parameter that Simplify removes because every path gives it one
   variable in scope where the continuation is defined
   (simplify/flow/control_flow_graph.ml,
   [minimize_extra_args_for_one_continuation], from the aliases that
   simplify/flow/dominator_graph.ml finds; FlambdaParamAliasesSpec.v
   says how the rounds follow it) is of the same shape. This pass
   takes it too where the rounds leave it in the term before: where
   the variable comes into the scope of the handler only once the
   continuation is placed under the [Let] that binds it, or is bound
   again somewhere in the scope of the continuation, off the path to
   an application.

   What the pass asks, of the parameter at a position of the handler
   of a non-recursive [Let_cont] of [k] ([unalias_param]):
   - that the handler is not an exception handler, and has a kind for
     the parameter;
   - that every mention of [k] in the body of the [Let_cont] is an
     application of [k] ([all_give_var]): no call returns or raises to
     [k], no trap action names it, and no [Let_cont] inside binds [k]
     again. An application of [k] may carry a trap action that names
     another continuation;
   - that every such application gives the parameter a variable, the
     same in all ([first_given_var] finds it in the first), and that
     no [Let] and no parameter of a handler binds that variable
     between the [Let_cont] of [k] and the application, so that it is
     there the variable that the handler of [k] sees. The bodies of
     code are not looked into: code runs with its own continuations,
     and a [k] there is not this one;
   - that the variable is not a parameter of the handler, and that the
     parameter is not at another position of the handler too.
   The positions are tried from the last to the first ([unalias_from]),
   in every non-recursive [Let_cont] of the term, the innermost first
   ([unalias_params]). The handlers of recursive continuations and the
   bodies of code are not gone into: FlambdaNormaliseSpec.rewrite_code
   and [rewrite_rec_handlers] take a pass there.

   The result is equivalent to the term
   ([unalias_params_equivalent_statement]), under all environments.
   Nothing is asked of the names of the term beyond what the pass
   checks itself. A variable that is not bound at all passes: the
   application is undefined in the term, and the [Let] is in the
   result.

   Renaming: the functions here compare names by equality only and
   make none. The pass commutes with every renaming and keeps scope;
   those two statements are in FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceSpec.v and
   in FlambdaStaticsScopeSpec.v.

   The proofs are in FlambdaUnaliasParamsProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
