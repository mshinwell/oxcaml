(* Where static bindings may be: the well-formedness of a compilation unit.

   This file is to be reviewed: [statics_at_toplevel] against the
   definition of toplevel in Simplify
   (simplify/simplify_let_cont_expr.ml, at_unit_toplevel, and
   Downwards_env.at_unit_toplevel), [sets_well_formed] against what the
   compiler checks of a set of closures (terms/static_const.ml,
   match_against_bound_static_pattern) and what it assumes
   (terms/function_declarations.ml, create), [numbers_in_range] against
   the types of the compiler's numbers (the comment of its section says
   which), [unit_exn_handlers_well_formed] and [traps_well_formed]
   against what the backend requires of the terms it is given
   (to_cmm/to_cmm_expr.ml: translate_raise, translate_apply,
   let_cont_exn_handler; backend/select_utils.ml: combine_traps,
   set_traps) and what the front end builds
   (from_lambda/lambda_to_flambda.ml, the case Ltrywith;
   closure_conversion.ml, close_raise0), [well_formed_unit], and the
   statements. Three of the conditions of [well_formed_unit] are
   defined in FlambdaBindersSpec.v and are reviewed there, against the
   compiler's binders: [names_in_scope], [binders_distinct] and
   [code_closed].

   Flambda permits a [Let_static] at the toplevel of a compilation unit
   only, so that it is executed once, before anything that follows it.
   Toplevel is:
   - the unit itself;
   - the body of a [Let], of a [Let_static] or of a [Let_cont] that is at
     toplevel;
   - the handler of a non-recursive continuation bound at toplevel, which
     is not an exception handler, when all its body can do is to apply
     that continuation or raise to the exception continuation of the
     unit: the handler then postdominates its body.
   Nothing else is: not the handler of a recursive continuation, which may
   run many times, and never the body of code, which runs once for each
   call.

   [statics_at_toplevel] is this as a check, carrying down the term
   whether it is at toplevel, as Simplify does. [well_formed_unit] asks
   also that no code id or symbol is bound twice, that the sets of
   closures of the unit are whole ([sets_well_formed]), that its
   numbers are in range ([numbers_in_range]), and that its exception
   handlers and trap actions are in order
   ([unit_exn_handlers_well_formed], [traps_well_formed]).

   It asks three things of the variables and the continuations of the
   unit as well, which are rows 3, 5 and 6 of the table of
   requests/C0-well-formed.md:
   - every variable and every continuation that the unit uses is bound
     around the use, but for the two continuations of its interface
     ([names_in_scope]);
   - the names that one binder binds are distinct: the parameters of a
     handler; the parameters of code and its [my_closure], which is so
     not one of them; the two continuations of code; the continuations
     of a recursive group, which is not empty ([binders_distinct]);
   - code is closed: its body has no free variable but its parameters
     and [my_closure], and no free continuation but its two; what the
     body binds itself it may use ([code_closed]).
   The first the compiler checks where a name is visited (Simplify
   stops on a name that its environment has not got), not where a term
   is built. In the last two the model asks more than the compiler
   checks, by the ruling that it may where the condition ought to be an
   invariant; FlambdaBindersSpec.v says at each definition what the
   compiler does.
   What they give is that the run of a well-formed unit reads no
   variable that has no value and leaves only by a continuation of its
   interface ([well_formed_names_bound_statement], from
   FlambdaScopeSpec.v).

   The model can express sets of closures that the compiler does not
   make (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v says what the machine does with them).
   [sets_well_formed] is what the compiler's sets have that the model's
   may lack:
   - a closure is at a function slot of its set, and the function slots
     of a set are distinct;
   - the functions of a set have each their own code id. The compiler
     builds a set in which two have the same, and Simplify fails on it;
     such a term is not well-formed Flambda 2 (the human's ruling);
   - the closures of a static set are bound together. The compiler binds
     them with one pattern; here each symbol has a binding of its own,
     which repeats the set and the symbols of its closures, and the
     check is that one group has the binding of each symbol of the set,
     all with the same set;
   - the static sets that one group binds have no code in common, be
     they of one function or of several. Simplify fails on a group two
     of whose sets have the same code.
   It does not ask that the value slots of a set are distinct (the
   compiler's are a map), nor that a code id is named by one set only:
   two sets of a unit may have the same code, unless they are static
   and one group binds them both.
   FlambdaClosuresSpec.v says what follows for a well-formed unit: it
   never makes a closure at a slot its set has not got, and the symbols
   of a static set are bound to its closures in every state of its run.

   Exception handlers and trap actions. The machine does not execute
   trap actions and goes by the names in a term: a raise goes to the
   continuation it names, and an exception of a call to the exception
   continuation the call names (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v). The code that
   the backend makes has a stack of handlers and goes by that: a [Push]
   installs a handler on it and a [Pop] removes the one installed last,
   whatever continuation the trap action names; a raise goes to the
   handler installed last, whatever continuation it names; and so does
   an exception raised by a call, whatever exception continuation the
   call names. Two checks are of what the front end keeps to, under
   which the names and such a stack cannot part, and the handlers of a
   term are what the backend takes them for:
   - [unit_exn_handlers_well_formed]: exception handlers are apart from
     the other continuations. A handler says whether it is one
     ([handler_is_exn_handler]). One that does is not applied as an
     ordinary continuation and takes the exception; one that does not
     is not named by a trap action nor as the exception continuation of
     a call; none is recursive. Of the continuations that a unit, or
     code, does not bind, only the exception continuation is used as an
     exception handler, and that by calls and raises only; and no call
     gives one extra arguments ([ways_out_well_formed]);
   - [traps_well_formed]: the discipline of trap actions. The check
     follows the term with the stack of the handlers installed, as a
     list of continuation names, the last installed first. The body of
     code, and a unit, start with one handler installed: their
     exception continuation, which stands for the handler of the
     caller. A [Pop], a raise and the exception continuation of a call
     name the handler installed last; a continuation is entered with
     one stack, however it is reached; code returns, and a unit ends,
     with the stack they started with.
   Both are stricter than anything the compiler checks; the comment at
   each definition says what the compiler does check. Both are
   conditions of [well_formed_unit]. FlambdaTrapSpec.v has a machine
   with a stack of handlers and the statement of what the discipline
   buys: a unit that follows it, and whose binders are distinct,
   behaves on that machine as it does on this one. The first check has
   no such statement yet. FlambdaTrapProofs.v has examples of terms
   that each check accepts and refuses.

   The machine enforces the part of this that keeps a static binding from
   being executed more than once. Calling code whose body binds something
   static is undefined, as is a [Let_cont_recursive] one of whose handlers
   does (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.binds_statics); and binding a name that is
   bound already is undefined
   (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.eval_static_bindings). It follows, for any term,
   that what a code id or a symbol is bound to never changes during a run
   ([step_extends_statics_statement], [run_extends_statics_statement]):
   this is what a rewrite needs, to rely in a handler on a binding made
   before the handler was defined. That the handler of a non-recursive
   continuation with static bindings postdominates its body is left to
   the check here.

   A well-formed unit, run on its own, is never undefined for one of
   these reasons ([well_formed_never_faults_statement]): [static_fault]
   is the three of them, as a test on a state. The proof does not use
   that a handler with static bindings postdominates its body: a
   non-recursive continuation is out of scope in its own handler, which
   is enough for the handler to run once at most.

   A handler says whether it is an exception handler
   (FlambdaModel.handler_is_exn_handler), and toplevel goes by that.
   [raises_to] says whether an expression uses a continuation as one: a
   call names it as its exception continuation, or a trap action names
   it.

   The proofs are in FlambdaWellFormedProofs.v, which needs no review. *)

(* The numbers of a term are among those that the compiler's can be.
   - The tag of every block made, by a [Make_block] or statically, and
     the tag that a [Block_load] names, is at least 0 and below 251.
   - Every constant is in the range of its kind, wherever it is: an
     argument, a value slot, a field of a static block, the contents of
     a static boxed number, the scrutinee of a [Switch].
   - The field and the size of a [Block_load] and the discriminants of
     a [Switch] are integers of the target's OCaml, and the bytes of a
     string are bytes.
   FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.v says what the ranges are (the section "Numbers
   in range").

   This is not stricter than the compiler: there each of these numbers
   is of a type whose values are in range ([Tag.Scannable.t],
   [Reg_width_const.t], [Target_ocaml_int.t], [string]), so every term
   it builds passes. The model's numbers are integers, and without the
   check it has terms that the compiler has not: a block with tag 300,
   an int8 that is 200. The machine does not test the tag of a block,
   and the arithmetic has no value on a constant out of range.

   FlambdaRangeSpec.v says what the check gives: in the run of a unit
   that passes, and so of a well-formed unit, every number that a state
   holds is in range. *)

(* The continuations that the expression does not bind, where it is the

   their exception continuation, and by the trap actions of raises, and
   is not installed or removed by another trap action; and no call gives
   one of them extra arguments. For code that is closed the others are
   its return continuation alone.

   The model is stricter than the compiler here.
   - That the return continuation is not used as an exception handler:
     for code, to_cmm fails on a trap action that names the return
     continuation of a function
     (To_cmm_expr.translate_jump_to_continuation, by
     To_cmm_env.get_cmm_continuation). For a unit nothing checks it:
     to_cmm gives the return continuation of the unit a handler of its
     own, as for an ordinary continuation (To_cmm.unit0), and lets
     through a trap action that names it. Discrepancy R1-22.
   - That no call gives extra arguments to one of them: Simplify stops
     on such a call when it visits it, and only by accident (an
     [Invalid_argument] in Continuation_uses_env.add_continuation_use).
     Without this the machine would leave the term with the exception
     followed by the extra arguments, where the exception continuation
     of code and of a unit takes the exception alone. It is an invariant
     of what the front end and the transformations build, which give
     extra arguments only to the handlers of a [try]. It is not an
     agreement of kinds, and it says nothing of a way out that is
     applied to the wrong number of values in another way, which stays
     defined. Discrepancy C5-5.
   For the second thing asked, that [exn] is not installed or removed
   apart from a raise, the compiler has a check when it visits the term:
   to_cmm stops on a trap action that names the exception continuation
   of a function, or of a unit, unless it is that of a raise
   (To_cmm_expr.translate_jump_to_continuation, by
   To_cmm_env.get_cmm_continuation, which does not find it). Discrepancy

(* Exception handlers are kept apart from the other continuations.
   - A handler that says it is an exception handler
     ([handler_is_exn_handler]) is not applied as an ordinary
     continuation in the body of its [Let_cont], and has a parameter for
     the exception. ([Trap_action]: "continuations cannot be used both
     as an exception handler and as a normal continuation". When it
     visits them, to_cmm fails on an [Apply_cont] of an exception handler
     that has no [Pop] (To_cmm_expr.translate_raise) and on an exception
     handler with no parameter (To_cmm_env.add_exn_handler).)
   - A handler that does not say so is not used as an exception handler
     there: no trap action names its continuation and no call has it as
     its exception continuation.
   - No handler of a recursive [Let_cont] is an exception handler
     ([Let_cont_expr.create_recursive] fails on one), and none is used
     as one.
   - In code, [ways_out_well_formed], and the exception continuation is
     not applied as an ordinary continuation.

   The model is stricter than the compiler here. Nothing in Flambda 2
   checks that a continuation used as an exception handler says that it
   is one, nor that an exception handler is not the return continuation
   of a call: to_cmm treats an [Apply_cont] by whether the continuation
   applied is an exception handler (To_cmm_expr.apply_cont, by
   To_cmm_env.is_exn_handler) and does not look at the handler that a
   trap action or a call names. The front end marks the handlers it
   installs, and Simplify removes the trap actions that name a handler
   when it clears the mark (Simplify_common.clear_demoted_trap_action).

   - a continuation is entered with one stack, however it is reached:
     all that apply it do so, after their trap actions, with the same
     handlers installed, and its handler is checked under those. For an
     exception handler, that stack is the one under it where it is
     installed, which is the same at each [Push], and is what is left
     when a raise or a call comes to it;
   - a name that is on the stack is not bound again, and is not on the
     stack of a continuation that is entered from outside its scope. So
     a name on the stack means one handler.
   The check is for a term whose binders are distinct
   (FlambdaBindersSpec.binders_distinct, which a well-formed unit is
   asked before this): it does not ask again that the continuations of
   a recursive [Let_cont] have distinct names, nor that the return and
   exception continuations of code are two names.
   The stack with which a continuation is entered is not written in the
   term: it is found from the applications of the continuation, in the
   body of its [Let_cont] and, for a recursive one, in the handlers of
   its group. It cannot be the stack where the [Let_cont] stands: the
   front end defines the continuation of the body of a [try] outside
   the [try] and enters it with a [Push], and Simplify lifts
   continuations out of handlers. A handler that nothing applies is not
   checked: it never runs.

   The model is stricter than the compiler here. Nothing in

   continuation is reached with one stack and that no [Pop] finds the
