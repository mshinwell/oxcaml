(* The liftings to symbols without the test of the exits, up to what
   may follow a unit.

   This file is to be reviewed: the four functions, each against the
   function that it stands beside; [liftings_observed] and
   [with_lifting_observed], against FlambdaValidateSpec.with_lifting;
   and the six statements.

   Each of the four liftings has a function that makes it of a unit if
   its conditions hold: FlambdaLiftFromArmsSpec.lift_to_head_unit,
   FlambdaLiftFromCodeSpec.lift_from_code_unit, FlambdaLiftSpec.lift_unit
   and FlambdaLiftAroundSpec.lift_around_unit. The first condition of
   each is FlambdaLiftSpec.exits_plain: the unit exits with symbols and
   constants only. With it, the unit lifted exits with the same values
   as the unit, and the statement of each is a refinement in which the
   exits are equal. Without it, the unit lifted may exit with a symbol
   where the unit exits with the closure, the block or the boxed number
   that the symbol is bound to (FlambdaLiftSpec.value_lifted), and the
   two exits are not equal.

   The functions here are those four with that one condition left out
   and every other condition kept. What is stated of each is
   FlambdaObserversSpec.refines_under_observers: the unit and the unit
   lifted, run from one continuation environment of what may follow a
   unit (FlambdaObserversSpec.observers), from the static environment
   of the imports of the unit (FlambdaImportsSpec.imports_statics) and
   the empty heap, come to results that
   FlambdaObserversSpec.observed_refines relates. An exit of the first
   is answered by an exit of the second through the same continuation,
   with the same constants and the same locations among its values and
   a heap that binds the same locations; and the second ends only if
   the first exits or goes wrong. What may follow a unit is a way out,
   or a handler with no environment of its own that binds nothing
   static and names no symbol and no code id: it has the values that
   the unit gave it and nothing else, and may read them, project from
   them and call them.

   So, where the unit lifted gives a symbol and the unit a closure, a
   block or a boxed number, nothing that follows and reads what it was
   given tells the two apart. The statements say nothing of a term that
   follows and names a symbol of the unit, as another unit does; and
   nothing where the unit goes wrong. They are one-way, as
   FlambdaSemanticsSpec.refines is.

   Each has the premise of the statement of the lifting from the
   imports (FlambdaLiftSpec.lift_unit_refines_imports_statement and the
   three like it): the unit lifted binds no name that the imports bind
   (FlambdaImportsSpec.static_names_free_in). With no import it holds
   of every term.

   [liftings_observed] makes the four in turn, each where its
   conditions hold, and [with_lifting_observed] is
   FlambdaValidateSpec.with_lifting with the four functions here in
   place of the four with the test: it ends by binding the tables that
   the guess gives at the head of the unit
   (FlambdaUnusedHeadStaticsSpec.add_head_tables). The four in turn are
   stated as each is ([liftings_observed_refines_statement]), and so is
   [with_lifting_observed]
   ([with_lifting_observed_refines_statement]): the tables bound at
   the head refine the term under continuations in which their symbols
   do not occur
   (FlambdaUnusedHeadStaticsSpec.add_head_tables_refines_under_statement),
   and what may follow a unit names no symbol.
   That [with_lifting_observed] commutes with renaming and keeps scope
   is in FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceSpec.v and
   FlambdaStaticsScopeSpec.v, beside the same of [with_lifting].

   Whether this is what the verdict on a unit that is lifted is to
   mean has not been decided (FlambdaObserversSpec.v). No function of
   the validation calls the functions here.

   The proofs are in FlambdaLiftObservedProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
