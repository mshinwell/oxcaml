(* The value slots of a static set of closures that nothing projects are
   removed.

   This file is to be reviewed: [drop_slots], against what Simplify does
   (below); [slots_unused], the check; [drop_unused_slots], which is
   extracted and run by the validation of
   middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/; and the statements.

   What Simplify does. Where it binds the symbols of a set of closures,
   one that was static or one that it has just lifted
   (FlambdaLiftSpec.v), it leaves out of the set every value slot that
   no projection uses: simplify/expr_builder.ml,
   [remove_unused_value_slots], called by [create_let_symbols], which
   keeps a slot if [Name_occurrences.value_slot_is_used_or_imported] says
   so of the value slots used in projections ([UA.used_value_slots]). A
   projection is counted where it is simplified and stays a projection
   (simplify/simplify_unary_primitive.ml,
   [simplify_project_value_slot], [DA.add_use_of_value_slot]), in the
   whole unit, on the way down; so a slot may be kept that no projection
   of the term rebuilt uses. A set of closures that is not static keeps
   its value slots here. This happens to every module that exports a
   function which calls another function of the module: the first is a
   value slot of the closure of the second, read by its code, and once
   the call is made direct, or inlined, nothing reads it.

   What is here. [drop_slots dropped e] removes the value slots
   [dropped] from every static set of closures that [e] binds, wherever
   the binding is. It is right only if no projection of such a slot is
   executed. For a unit run on its own it is enough that the unit has no
   projection of one at all, in code and in handlers too, which is what
   [slots_unused dropped e] checks: every closure that the run reads is
   then one that the unit made, and every projection one of the unit's.
   Under other environments the term may be given a closure whose code,
   bound elsewhere, projects the slot; so this is no rewrite under all
   environments, and it is said of a unit run on its own
   ([drop_unused_slots_program_refines_statement]).

   No value changes: a value does not hold what a symbol is bound to,
   and a closure that is not static keeps its slots. So nothing is asked
   of what the unit exits with.

   The model has no imported value slots (a unit refers to no other),
   so [dropped] is any list of value slots. Which slots is a guess of
   the caller's, read off the term after Simplify; nothing is believed
   of it. A slot that Simplify kept, though nothing projects it, is not
   in the guess, and stays.

   It refines and is not an equivalence: a slot whose contents have no
   value (a variable that is not bound) makes the binding undefined
   before and not after.

   The proofs are in FlambdaUnusedSlotsProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
