(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaUnusedParamsSpec.v. Nothing here
   needs review.

   The pass changes a binder and every application in its scope, so it
   is not a rewrite of two expressions on their own. The term and its
   result are run side by side, by rounds
   (FlambdaRoundsProofs.rounds_refines): step for step, but for the
   [Let]s that the second has not got. The relation between the two
   states ([state_drops]) is:

   - the second expression is the first with parameters and arguments
     removed as some [masks] say, and with some [Let]s removed whose
     variables it does not use ([drops]). [drop_unused_params] removes
     no [Let]; FlambdaDeadParamsSpec.drop_dead_params, which is proved
     through the same relation (FlambdaDeadParamsProofs.v), does. This
     is a relation and not
     the function: where a function is called the two runs go into the
     same body, which is related to itself with every parameter kept
     ([drops_refl]), and the pass run on the term is one way of choosing
     the masks ([drop_params_drops]). There the mask of a recursive
     continuation is found from its handler as it stands; that the
     parameters it removes are not free in the handler once that is
     done is because the relation adds no free variable
     ([drops_free]);
   - the variables of the two states agree on the free variables of the
     second expression. They are not the same: the first run binds the
     parameters that the second has not got;
   - each continuation name stands, in the two states, for the same
     thing or for closures whose handlers are so related, whose
     variables so agree and whose continuations are in turn so related
     ([cont_drops]), the second taking only the parameters that the
     mask of the name keeps.

   Applying two such closures, the first to the values of all the
   arguments and the second to those kept, gives states so related
   ([bind_params_masked]): the parameters removed are not free in the
   second handler. The machine tests the kinds of the values against
   those that the handler gives (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.apply_cont_value);
   the second handler gives the kinds kept, so where the values are of
   the kinds of the first, those kept are of the kinds of the second
   ([kinds_masked]). *)
