(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaKnownSymbolsSpec.v. Nothing here
   needs review.

   The unit and the unit folded are run side by side, in step, with the
   same values. Two things are kept along the run of the unit: its
   terms bind the known symbols as the unit says
   (FlambdaClosuresProofs.terms_inv_step), so what the run has bound of
   them is what is known ([agrees]). A defining expression that has a
   value in such a static environment has the same value in the known
   one, by the laws of the primitives about a static environment that
   grows (FlambdaPrimitiveProofs.eval_prim_statics_extend).

   The two runs may start from a continuation environment of what may
   follow a unit (FlambdaObserversSpec.observers). What follows is the
   same term in the two runs, and the folding is not the identity on
   it: a primitive applied to constants is folded wherever it is. So
   the second state is not the first with every term folded. It is
   given by a relation ([state_kept]): each term that the first state
   keeps, its expression and the handlers of its continuations, is
   folded in the second or, if it binds nothing static, left as it is;
   the code is folded. A step is answered for the two ways
   ([kept_step_components]). For a unit run on its own nothing is left
   as it is. *)
