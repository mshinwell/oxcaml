(* The two actions on what may follow a unit.

   This file is to be reviewed: the statements. It has no definition.

   FlambdaObserversSpec.v says what a unit may be followed by
   ([observer], [observers]), by what two results of a step are
   compared there ([observed_refines], which compares an exit by its
   continuation, by the constants and the locations among its values
   ([same_scalars]) and by the locations that its heap binds), when no
   observer tells two worlds apart ([worlds_observed]), and the form in
   which a pass proves it of two units ([refines_under_observers]).
   FlambdaEquivarianceSpec.v has the action of the renamings of
   variables and continuations on states, FlambdaLocationsSpec.v that
   of the permutations of locations, and FlambdaExitWorldActionsSpec.v
   the two on a world. This file says how the definitions of
   FlambdaObserversSpec.v go through them.

   A renaming. What is renamed is renamed jointly: the continuation of
   an exit, what a continuation stands for, a continuation environment,
   the code of a static environment and the two terms, by one renaming.
   - What a step comes to has the behaviours of what it comes to
     renamed, renamed ([step_result_behaves_equivariant_statement]),
     and [observed_refines] holds of two results exactly when it holds
     of the two renamed ([observed_refines_equivariant_statement]): an
     exit is compared by its continuation, which is renamed on both
     sides, and by values and a heap, which hold no variables or
     continuations.
   - The three tests of an observer answer the same of a term renamed:
     a renaming brings no static binding in or out
     ([binds_no_static_equivariant_statement]), it renames no symbol
     and no code id ([expr_statics_in_scope_equivariant_statement]),
     and no value slot
     (FlambdaUnusedSlotsSpec.slots_unused_equivariant_statement). So
     what a continuation stands for is an observer exactly when it is
     one renamed ([observer_equivariant_statement]), and so of a
     continuation environment ([observers_equivariant_statement]).
   - So [worlds_observed] relates two worlds exactly when it relates
     the two renamed ([worlds_observed_equivariant_statement]): every
     renaming keeps it, in the sense of
     FlambdaExitWorldActionsSpec.refines_world_kept_statement, and the
     comparison of two units is kept both ways
     ([refines_world_observed_equivariant_statement]).
   - The form in which a pass proves it holds of two terms, from a
     static environment, exactly when it holds of the two terms and
     of the code of the static environment renamed
     ([refines_under_observers_equivariant_statement]). The heap is
     left: it holds no variables or continuations.
   None of these has a premise.

   A class of what may follow a unit. FlambdaObserversSpec.v has the two
   relations over a class of continuation values that is given, in the
   place of the observers ([worlds_observed_by], [refines_observed_by]);
   the two over the observers are those at the class [observer slots].
   For every class that a renaming keeps, in that what is in the class
   is in it renamed, the two relations, and the comparison of two units
   by the first, hold exactly when they hold of what is renamed
   ([worlds_observed_by_equivariant_statement],
   [refines_world_observed_by_equivariant_statement],
   [refines_observed_by_equivariant_statement]). The three statements
   above that have a universal over the observers on each side are
   these at the class [observer slots], which a renaming keeps
   ([observer_equivariant_statement]); and these say the same of a
   class of some of the observers, where a renaming keeps it. The class
   is under an outer universal and nothing is asked of it but that: no
   observer is named.

   A permutation of locations. One permutation, applied to both sides.
   - A value is a constant or a location exactly when the value moved
     is ([scalar_permuted_statement]), so two lists of values have the
     same constants and the same locations at the same places exactly
     when the two lists moved have
     ([same_scalars_permuted_statement]).
   - The locations that a heap moved binds are those that the heap
     binds, moved, in their order and as many times
     ([heap_domain_permuted_statement]).
   - So what the way out compares of two worlds
     (FlambdaObserversSpec.worlds_observed_way_out_statement: the
     continuation, the constants and the locations among the values,
     the locations that the heap binds) is the same of the two worlds
     exactly when it is the same of the two moved by one permutation
     ([way_out_permuted_statement]).

   What is not here. [observed_refines] of two results moved, and
   [worlds_observed] of two worlds moved. What is proved of a run
   under a permutation of locations
   (FlambdaLocationsMachineSpec.run_permuted_statement,
   FlambdaExitWorldActionsSpec.exits_world_permuted_statement) gives
   each run its exit up to a second permutation, which agrees with the
   first on the locations bound at the start and of which nothing else
   is said; the source and the target each have their own. The
   comparison by [same_scalars] and by the locations that the heaps
   bind is by [=], so those statements do not by themselves give the
   two laws. A handler that is an observer may be written with a
   primitive that allocates; no step of the machine of
   FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v allocates yet. Whether the two laws hold is
   not said here, either way. Nothing is said with two permutations.

   Nothing is trusted here. The proofs are in
   FlambdaObserversActionsProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
