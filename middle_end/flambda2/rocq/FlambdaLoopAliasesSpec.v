(* Following aliases into the handlers of recursive continuations: a
   normalisation that is an equivalence.

   This file is to be reviewed: [follow_aliases_in_loops], which is
   extracted and run by the validation of
   middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/, and the statement.

   ../types/rocq/FlambdaAliasesSpec.follow_aliases replaces a variable
   bound by a [Let] to a [Simple] by what it is bound to, in the body of
   the [Let] and in the handlers of the non-recursive continuations
   there; it leaves the handlers of recursive continuations as they are.
   FlambdaRecHandlersSpec.rewrite_rec_handlers takes it into such a
   handler, but with nothing known: an alias bound outside the loop is
   not followed inside it. Simplify follows it: the handler of a
   recursive continuation is simplified under the environment of its
   [Let_cont], to which the parameters are added at unknown types
   (simplify/simplify_let_cont_expr.ml,
   [simplify_single_recursive_handler]). The front end binds the bound
   of a [for] loop before the loop, so the term after has the constant
   in the test of the loop and the term before a variable.

   [follow_aliases_in_loops] goes through a term keeping what
   [follow_aliases] keeps (the typing environment of
   FlambdaAliasesSpec.typing_env_under_let), and changes only the
   handlers of the recursive continuations: each is given to
   [follow_aliases] with what is known where the [Let_cont] is, less
   what mentions the parameters of the handler
   (FlambdaAliasesSpec.drop_vars), after the loops inside it have been
   done in the same way. A handler is left alone if that would change
   whether it binds something static
   (FlambdaNormaliseSpec.rewrite_code_body); [follow_aliases] never
   does, but that is not needed here.

   Why this is right although the handler runs many times: what is
   known where the [Let_cont] is holds of the variables of its closure,
   which do not change; and the parameters, which do, are forgotten.

   The [Let]s are not changed here, so what is known under one is what
   it says as it stands; [follow_aliases] itself is to be run before,
   and again after.

   Renaming: the pass compares names by equality only and binds none; it
   commutes with a renaming where [follow_aliases] does. That statement
   is owed to the nominal work and is not made here.

   The proofs are in FlambdaLoopAliasesProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
