(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaForwardJumpsSpec.v. Nothing here
   needs review.

   The pass is FlambdaForwardSpec.forward_applications with fewer
   entries, and the relation between a term and its result is that of
   FlambdaForwardProofs.v, taken strict: every entry is for a
   continuation of no parameters whose handler gives no kinds
   ([jumps]), so an application that goes on has no arguments, which
   are trivially of the kinds of the parameters. An application of the
   first term that goes on is then defined where the [Apply_cont] it
   becomes is: there is no argument to evaluate, no kind to test and
   nothing to bind. So the first run is undefined only where the
   second is, the rounds of FlambdaForwardProofs.v are read both ways
   ([fwd_round], [fwd_round_back]), and each term refines the other. *)
