(* The code of a unit bound first: a normalisation of a unit that is run
   on its own.

   This file is to be reviewed: [code_bindings], [without_code],
   [closures_in_scope] and [hoist_code], which are extracted and run by
   the validation of middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/, and the
   statements.

   The two terms of a unit do not bind code in the same places
   (FlambdaFloatCodeSpec.v says where each does). A function defined
   after a call that is not inlined, or after a branch that is not
   resolved, has its closure lifted by Simplify, and its new code bound,
   in the handler of the continuation that the call or the branch goes
   to; the conversion from Lambda has bound the code of the unit at its
   head. FlambdaFloatCodeSpec.float_code takes code to the head of the
   handler that it is in and no further.

   [hoist_code] binds all the code of the toplevel of a unit first: the
   bindings of code of its groups of static bindings, in handlers too
   ([code_bindings]), in one group around the unit with those bindings
   removed ([without_code]). Bindings of deleted code, which bind
   nothing, stay where they are, for
   FlambdaNormaliseSpec.drop_deleted_code to remove. The code of
   functions and the handlers of recursive continuations are not looked
   into for code to take out: the machine has no step for a call of
   code, or for a recursive [Let_cont], that binds something static.

   This is no equivalence under all environments, and not one of every
   unit run on its own. With its code bound first a unit may be defined
   where it was not: where a closure is called before its code is
   bound. And it may be undefined where it was defined: a code id that
   is bound a second time in a handler that is never entered is bound
   twice in the one group. So three things are checked of the unit,
   and no code is moved if one fails ([hoist_code] answers [None]).
   - Its static bindings are at toplevel
     (FlambdaWellFormedSpec.statics_at_toplevel, for one of its free
     continuations as the exception continuation of the unit), and bind
     each code id once (FlambdaWellFormedSpec.static_names, of the code
     ids). These are the first condition of
     FlambdaWellFormedSpec.well_formed_unit and, of the second, the part
     about code ids: that each symbol is bound once is not asked, as no
     binding of a symbol is moved. They are what the invariant of
     FlambdaWellFormedProofs.v asks, taken for code ids, to say that no
     code id is bound twice.
   - The code that is bound first has distinct code ids. This follows
     from the condition before; it is asked again, of the code in the
     order in which it is taken out, so that the proof need not relate
     the two orders.
   - Every closure is made of code that is bound by then
     ([closures_in_scope]): a [Let] or a static binding that makes a
     closure is under the binding of the code of each function of its
     set, or in the same group. Then no closure of code that is not yet
     bound exists, and none is called.

   A unit that passes is equivalent, run on its own, to the unit with
   its code first ([hoist_code_program_equivalent_statement]): the two
   runs are in step, with the same values, and differ only in when the
   code is bound.

   The proofs are in FlambdaHoistCodeProofs.v, which needs no review. *)

(* CR mshinwell: this check is here, and not a premise taken from
   well-formedness, because FlambdaWellFormedSpec.well_formed_unit does
   not yet ask that the symbols and the code ids a term mentions are
   bound where they are mentioned (row 4 of the table of
   requests/C0-well-formed.md). When it does, this check and
   [closures_in_scope_run_statement] may give way to that condition and
   its invariant of states, but only if those give what is used here:
   that the code of every closure of a state is bound, so that a call
   finds the same code in both runs. The invariant as it is planned
   (every code id that a closure of a state holds is bound, or was
   declared deleted) is not enough by itself: if a code id that is
   declared deleted could be bound later, then with that code bound
   first a call of a closure made in between, which was undefined,
   would run. So the replacement needs that condition together with
   the one planned beside it, that the static names of a unit are
   distinct with the declarations of deleted code counted (a code id
   declared deleted is then not bound by the unit); this check stays
   until both are there. The check is not
   that condition for code ids. It asks less: of the closures that are
   made, and not of a direct call, which names a code id too (the
   machine has no step for a direct call unless its callee is a closure
   of the code named, so closures are enough here). And it asks more in
   two places: a handler is given only the code that is bound where its
   [Let_cont] is, where that condition also gives a toplevel handler
   the code that the body of its [Let_cont] binds at toplevel; and the
   code of a closure is to be bound, where that condition accepts code
   that is declared deleted. For a unit that fails the check in either
   place no code is moved; if it needed that to be validated, it stays
   not validated. *)
