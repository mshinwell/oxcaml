(* FlambdaUntagParamsSpec.untag_params commutes with renaming and keeps
   scope: the lemmas from which FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceProofs.v
   and FlambdaStaticsScopeProofs.v prove the two statements. There is
   no statement here, and nothing here needs review.

   The pass compares names by equality only and makes none. So each of
   its functions gives, on a renamed term, the renamed result: the
   rewrite and the test for renamed positions, and the positions that
   the validation uses, which are computed from the term. For the
   scope: the arguments of an application are the same in another
   order, but for constants and for the variables that the tags read,
   which a [Let] in scope read; the parameters of a handler are the same
   in another order; and the [Let] of a parameter mentions the
   variable that the untagging mentioned. *)
