(* What a run keeps of scope: a state in which every variable and every
   continuation that can be used is bound, and all code is closed.

   This file is to be reviewed: [cont_in_scope] and [state_in_scope]
   against [step] (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v), [variables_read] against the
   evaluations that [step] makes, and the statements.

   A unit that passes rows 3 and 6 of well-formedness
   (FlambdaBindersSpec.names_in_scope and [code_closed]) uses no
   variable and no continuation that is not bound around the use. The
   machine does not run a unit as a whole: it runs a state, in which
   part of the unit is the expression, part is in the handlers that the
   continuations keep, and part is the code of the static environment.
   [state_in_scope] is the condition on a state that a step keeps
   ([step_in_scope_statement]) and that the first state of such a unit
   meets ([unit_in_scope_statement]). It says, with [outer] the
   continuations by which the run may leave:
   - of the expression: its free variables have values, its free
     continuations are bound or are among [outer], and its code is
     closed;
   - of each handler that a continuation keeps, and of the handlers of
     its recursive group, the same under the environments kept: the
     free variables are bound by the environment kept, the free
     continuations by the group, by the continuation environment kept
     or by [outer]; and so on through the continuations kept;
   - of a way out ([Outer k]) that a continuation environment holds: [k]
     is among [outer];
   - of the static environment: the code it binds is closed.

   What follows of a state in scope:
   - its step reads no variable that has no value
     ([in_scope_reads_bound_statement]). This is where closed code is
     needed: a call runs the body of code under its parameters and
     [my_closure] and nothing of where the code was bound;
   - if its step is an exit, the exit is by one of [outer]
     ([step_in_scope_statement]). A continuation that is not bound is a
     way out in the machine and not a fault, so this is what "no
     continuation is used unbound" comes to.
   [unit_run_statement] is the two for the run of a unit.

   What this is not about:
   - symbols and code ids. A state in scope may mention a symbol that
     is not bound, and a closure in it may be of code that is not
     bound; that is row 4 of well-formedness;
   - values. No value holds a variable or a continuation, so the
     condition asks nothing of the values that the environments bind,
     only which names they bind;
   - that the names of a binder are distinct (row 5). The machine
     shadows, and nothing here needs it.

   The proofs are in FlambdaScopeProofs.v, which needs no review. *)

   becomes such a closure when this one is applied. The continuations
   kept are in scope in turn. A continuation with extra arguments is in
   scope when the one inside is: the extra arguments are values. What is
   left of an over-application names nothing; the two continuations it
   keeps are in scope. *)
