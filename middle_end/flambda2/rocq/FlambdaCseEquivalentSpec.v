(* Not computing again a primitive that has been computed: the result
   is equivalent to the term.

   This file is to be reviewed: the statement.

   FlambdaCseSpec.v defines [share_known_primitives] and states that
   its result refines the term; it says that the result is most likely
   equivalent to the term, and does not claim it. It is
   ([share_known_primitives_equivalent_statement]). A refinement is
   what a rewrite of the term before Simplify owes. A rewrite of the
   term after owes the converse, that the term refines its result; so
   a rewrite that the validation is to apply to both of the terms that
   it compares owes the equivalence.

   Why it holds is in the definition of what the pass knows
   (FlambdaCseSpec.all_computed): a variable known to hold the result
   of a primitive is bound, where the term runs, to the value that the
   primitive has on the values of its arguments. That says that the
   primitive has a value there, and which. So the [Let] of a primitive
   and the [Let] of the variable that the pass puts in its place bind
   the same value: the pass does not put a variable that has a value
   where a primitive had none, which a refinement would allow. The
   statement is about the pass as FlambdaCseSpec.v defines it,
   whatever [shareable] lists and whatever
   FlambdaCseSpec.computed_under_let adds, as long as [all_computed]
   is kept; that it is kept is proved in FlambdaCseProofs.v.

   The proofs are in FlambdaCseEquivalentProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
