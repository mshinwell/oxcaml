(* The parameters of continuations that hold a tagged immediate and
   are untagged, or passed on to where one is, are bound again to
   themselves at the head of their handlers: a normalisation that is
   an equivalence, and that prepares FlambdaTwinParamsSpec.twin_params.

   This file is to be reviewed: [shadow_expr] and what it is made of,
   and the statement. The pass is for the term before Simplify, in
   the validation of middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/, where
   FlambdaRenameApartSpec.rename_apart_avoiding is to come just
   after it; nothing applies it yet. Nothing is believed of the
   positions that it is to be run with ([shadow_positions]): the
   statement is about any positions.

   Why. Where Simplify unboxes a parameter of a continuation that
   holds a tagged immediate (simplify/unboxing/), the continuation
   gets a parameter more for the number, and the tagged parameter
   stays if something else uses it. So for a flag that a loop both
   tests and keeps,

     let any = ref false in
     for i = 0 to n do any := !any || i > limit done;
     !any

   the continuation where the arms of [||] meet has two parameters
   after Simplify, the flag as a value and the flag as a number,
   where it had one before. A pass on the term before that makes the
   second parameter needs a name for it, and the passes of the
   validation make no names but
   FlambdaRenameApartSpec.rename_apart_avoiding. This pass gives that
   one a binder to name:

     k (p) = body        becomes        k (p) = let p = p in body

   and after the renaming the handler is [k (p) = let p' = p in body]
   with [p'] for [p] in the body, which
   FlambdaTwinParamsSpec.twin_params makes [k (p', p) = body].

   [shadow_expr sites] puts, at the head of the handler of every
   continuation, a [Let] of each parameter at a position that [sites]
   has for the name of the continuation, to itself, with the kind
   that the handler gives that parameter ([shadow_lets]); the
   parameters are taken in their order. At the head of a handler
   whose parameters are not distinct no [Let] is put; its body is
   gone into as any other. The handlers of recursive
   continuations are gone into; the bodies of code are not:
   FlambdaNormaliseSpec.rewrite_code takes a pass there.

   The result is equivalent to the term
   ([shadow_expr_equivalent_statement]), under all environments,
   whatever the positions. Why it holds: a handler runs when it is
   given values of the kinds of its parameters, so each such [Let]
   has a value of its kind, and binds the variable to the value that
   it had.

   The positions that the pass is run with ([shadow_positions]): the
   parameters of kind [Value] of the handlers that are not exception
   handlers, outside code, that their handler untags somewhere, or
   gives to a continuation at such a position ([needed_positions],
   by rounds from nothing, six of them). Names are compared as they
   are, with no regard for scope. Nothing is claimed of these
   positions. Where there is none the pass gives the term back.

   What it is not: it does not say which parameters Simplify unboxes;
   a parameter bound again that FlambdaTwinParamsSpec.twin_params
   then leaves is followed and removed by the rounds, as any alias
   is.

   Renaming: the functions here compare names by equality only and
   make none. FlambdaShadowParamsNamesProofs.v has the lemmas that
   the pass commutes with renaming and keeps scope; the statements
   are in FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceSpec.v and
   FlambdaStaticsScopeSpec.v.

   The proofs are in FlambdaShadowParamsProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
