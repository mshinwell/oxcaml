(* Finite maps and sets keyed by names: the one representation of
   environments.

   This file is to be reviewed: the definitions, and the statements at the
   end, which say what each operation does in terms of [lookup] and
   [among]. Whatever maps names to things or collects names, in the
   semantics and in the types alike, is to be built with what is here: a
   file must not define its own lookup, membership test or merge. (The
   typing environment of today is not built so, and is not a map: see
   the end of this comment.) The lemmas are in FlambdaMapProofs.v, which
   needs no review; a lemma about these operations that is not about one
   construct of the terms belongs there, and nowhere else.

   Names. Variables, continuations, symbols, code ids and value slots are
   all [positive] (FlambdaModel.v), so one map and one set serve where the
   compiler has [Variable.Map], [Symbol.Map], [Code_id.Map],
   [Continuation.Map] and [Value_slot.Map], and the sets of each.

   The representation. A map is an association list ([finite_map]) in
   which the first binding of a name is the one that counts ([lookup]). A
   set of names is a list of them, in which a name may occur more than
   once ([among]). The empty map and the empty set are [[]]; to bind a
   name is to cons a pair, which shadows the bindings after it; the union
   of two sets is [++].

   Why lists.
   - The machine of FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v is built of them and every
     statement is written with them: a state's environments, the
     environments its continuation closures keep, and the static
     environment are association lists, extended by cons, which is the
     shadowing of the model's binders. Another representation would mean
     rewriting the machine and every Spec file, or having two.
   - They nest. A continuation closure holds an environment of
     continuation closures, a value holds the values of its slots, and
     types will hold maps of types. An inductive type may recur through
     [list], and functions and proofs over it are structural recursion
     through [map], [forallb] and [flat_map], which Rocq accepts as they
     stand.
   - They extract to OCaml lists and functions over them, with no functor
     and no proof carried in the data, and the conversion from the
     compiler's maps is [bindings].

   What was rejected.
   - Rocq's [FMapPositive] and [FMapAVL] (and the [MSet]s), whose lookups
     are logarithmic. Two maps with the same bindings need not be equal
     there either, so nothing is gained for equality. A proof about a
     type that recurs through one goes by induction on the tree inside
     the map and by the lemmas about [find] and [elements], where with a
     list it is [induction] on the list, as every nested proof here
     already is. The AVL maps are functors and extract as functors. And
     the machine and its proofs would have to be rewritten.
   - Canonical binary tries, in which maps with the same bindings are
     equal. The best for equality and for speed, but the installation
     has no such library (only Rocq's own), so it would have to be
     written and proved here; nesting is as for the trees above; and the
     machine and its proofs would have to be rewritten.
   - Functions [positive -> option A]: no domain to iterate over, nothing
     decidable, nothing to extract.
   - Sorted lists without duplicates, as a subset type: canonical, but to
     bind is no longer to cons, so the environments of closures share
     nothing, and proofs travel with the data.

   What this costs, and how to live with it.
   - [lookup] is linear and [merge] quadratic. The extracted code is for
     tests and differential comparison, not for the compiler.
   - Two maps that bind the same names to the same things need not be
     equal: say [map_equal], not [=], and state what an operation does by
     its [lookup] (as the statements here do), never by the list it
     returns. [compact] gives the bindings that count, one for each name,
     for when a map has to be gone through.
   - Only [lookup] and consing may look at the list. Go through the
     other operations and their lemmas, so that a faster representation
     can be put under them one day without touching their users.

   Keys that are not names. The types have maps and sets keyed by tags
   and by numbers, which are integers, and by the names of the types,
   each a variable or a symbol. The module [Keyed], in the second half
   of this file, is for those: it has every definition on names again,
   for keys of any type [K].
   - Each one that compares keys takes the equality test of the keys,
     [eqb : K -> K -> bool], as its first argument, and is otherwise the
     definition on names with [eqb] where that has [Pos.eqb].
     [Keyed.lookup Z.eqb tag cases] is the first case of a tag, and
     [Keyed.inter Z.eqb] the numbers of both of two sets. Those that
     compare no keys take no test: [Keyed.finite_map],
     [Keyed.map_values], [Keyed.tabulate] and [Keyed.is_empty].
   - Use one test for each type of key, named once, with the proof that
     it decides equality: [Pos.eqb] and [Pos.eqb_eq] for names, [Z.eqb]
     and [Z.eqb_eq] for integers, and for another type of key a test
     defined beside the type. The definitions accept any test. The
     statements speak only of one that decides equality; and two such
     tests, though they agree on every pair of keys, are two terms, so
     that a lemma used with one does not apply as it stands to a
     definition written with the other.
   - The statements about [Keyed] are the statements about names, for
     every [K] and every [eqb] that tells whether two keys are the same
     ([decides_equality]), as [Pos.eqb] and [Z.eqb] do. Nothing is
     stated for a test that takes two different keys for the same.
   - The definitions on names stay as they are, under their short
     names, for the machine and all that is written with it. Each is
     the one of [Keyed] at [Pos.eqb], by computation
     ([names_are_keys_statement]), so a lemma about [Keyed] applies to
     them as it stands, and nothing need be proved twice.
   - An operation that is added from now on is added to [Keyed] only.
     Those that go through a map ([Keyed.for_all_bindings],
     [Keyed.at_binding] and their tests) have short names on names;
     these are abbreviations, not definitions.
   - Changing the keys of a map ([Keyed.map_bindings], [Keyed.map_keys])
     and the folds that thread a state ([Keyed.fold2], [Keyed.merge_fold],
     [Keyed.tabulate_fold], [Keyed.tabulate_fold_opt],
     [Keyed.filter_map_fold] and those that take the keys to go through)
     are in [Keyed] only. A fold goes through the keys in the order of
     the list it is given, or, over a map, in the order of [domain]: the
     latest bound first. The statements say what a fold binds each key
     to and in which state it asks, so that nothing need be proved by
     the order in which a map happens to list its keys.

   Why the test is an argument, and what was rejected.
   - A copy of the definitions and of the statements for integers, and
     another for each type of key to come: as many of everything to
     review, and to keep the same.
   - A functor over the type of the keys, as OCaml's [Map.Make] and
     Rocq's [FMapInterface] are. Each type of key gets a module of its
     own; a statement cannot be about all of them, so each has its own
     copy of the statements to be checked; and the extracted code is
     functors.
   - A type class of keys, so that the test need not be written. Which
     test is used would then be nowhere in the text that uses it; this
     development has no type classes; and the extracted code would pass
     dictionaries.
   - Coding every key as a [positive], as an integer or a name can be,
     and keeping the one type of map. The grammar of types would show
     codes where the compiler has tags and names, every statement would
     be about [lookup (code tag)], and the coding would be one more
     thing to review.
   With the test as an argument, a definition says which equality it
   uses where it is used, [Keyed.lookup] is one function to review
   whatever the keys, and it extracts to an OCaml function that takes
   the test.

   An exception, for now: the typing environment. [typing_env] of
   FlambdaTypesSpec.v (in types/rocq) has the type of a map of types,
   [list (variable * flambda_type)], and is not one. It is a list of
   constraints: [env_satisfies] asks for every pair in the list, not for
   the first pair of each variable, so a variable listed twice has to
   have both types. [[(x, Unknown); (x, Bottom)]] and [[(x, Unknown)]]
   are [map_equal] and mean different things: no environment of values
   satisfies the first, and any that binds [x] satisfies the second. So
   [compact], or putting for a typing environment another that is
   [map_equal] to it, need not preserve [env_satisfies], and what is
   stated here by [lookup] says nothing of what a [typing_env] means.
   When the typing environment is rebuilt on these maps, with one type
   for each variable, what it asks of a variable must still be the
   conjunction of the constraints the list had for it (the meet of its
   types, not the first of them), and the migration has to prove that:
   that [env_satisfies] is preserved. *)
