(* The terms of Flambda 2 as the semantics sees them: a fragment.

   This file is to be reviewed, against middle_end/flambda2/terms/flambda.mli
   and the modules it refers to. It holds definitions only. The fragment has
   - the constants ([Reg_width_const.t]), in full but for the string of
     [Poison]; the kinds ([Flambda_kind.t]) are in FlambdaKindModel.v;
   - [Let] of one variable, bound to a [Simple], a primitive application, a
     closure of a new set of closures, or the projection of a value slot
     or of a function slot; the primitives ([Flambda_primitive.t]) are in
     FlambdaPrimitiveModel.v, a fragment of their own;
   - [Let] with the bound pattern [Static] ("let symbol"), here
     [Let_static]: a group of bindings of code ids to code and of symbols
     to static constants;
   - [Let_cont], non-recursive and recursive;
   - [Apply] of a function, direct or indirect, with a return continuation
     and an exception continuation, which may have extra arguments
     ([Exn_continuation.t]);
   - [Apply_cont], with its trap action ([Trap_action.t]);
   - [Switch];
   - [Invalid].

   What is left out, and is to be added in later steps:
   - of a set of closures: a function slot whose code is deleted
     ([Function_declarations.Deleted]), the allocation mode (a set on the
     stack is not told from one on the heap), [only_full_applications],
     and everything about its layout in memory;
   - the static constants that are arrays or float blocks, and mutable
     blocks and strings;
   - [Rec_info];
   - the other call kinds (methods, C calls, effects), [Never_returns],
     partial and over-application, and the modes and inlining attributes
     of an [Apply];
   - the [is_cold] flag of continuation handlers, and the
     [is_applied_with_traps] of a non-recursive [Let_cont], which says
     of its body what can be read there;
   - subkinds and nullability ([Flambda_kind.With_subkind]), debuginfo,
     and every annotation that has no effect on execution.

   Kinds. A variable has a kind, given where it is bound: the compiler's
   [Variable.kind]. A [Let] gives the kind of its variable; a
   continuation handler gives the kinds of its parameters; code gives the
   arity of its parameters and that of its results, and an [Apply] the
   two arities it calls at ([Apply_expr.args_arity], [return_arity]) and
   the kind of each extra argument of its exception continuation. An
   arity ([arity]) is the compiler's [Flambda_arity.t]: it keeps how the
   parameters are grouped into unboxed products, which the compiler
   compares at a call, while the parameters and the arguments themselves
   are unarized, here as there. Execution (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v) looks
   at none of these but the arities of a call and of the code called.

   What a handler and code are annotated with is a record each
   ([handler_metadata], [code_metadata]), so that a later annotation is
   one more field and no term changes shape for it. Make one with
   [make_handler_metadata] or [make_code_metadata], read it with its
   projections, and bind it whole in a pattern; do not apply the
   constructor of the record or take one apart by position. A field
   added later is then given, by the function, the value that leaves a
   term written before with its meaning.

   Exception handlers. A handler says whether it is an exception
   handler ([hm_is_exn_handler], the compiler's
   [Continuation_handler.is_exn_handler]): one that trap actions install
   and remove, and that raises and the exceptions of calls go to.
   Execution does not look at the flag. [make_handler_metadata] makes a
   handler that is not one, and [make_exn_handler_metadata] one that
   is.

   Kinds, arities and the two records of metadata have no names in them.
   Renaming a term leaves them as they are, and two terms that are the
   same up to the names they bind have the same ones.

   Differences of presentation from the compiler:
   - Variables and continuations are plain names. The compiler works up to
     alpha-equivalence ([Name_abstraction]); here a binder shadows, and the
     semantics (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v) uses environments and closures, so
     no substitution and no freshness condition is needed to define
     execution. Symbols and code ids are plain names in the compiler too.
   - The two forms of [Let_cont] are two constructors of [expr], and the
     [Let] of static constants a third, [Let_static].
   - A [Let_static] pairs each name with what it is bound to
     ([static_binding]), where the compiler has a [Bound_static.t] and a
     [Static_const_group.t] side by side.
   - A recursive [Let_cont] in the compiler has [invariant_params] shared
     by all its handlers; here every handler lists all its parameters, the
     invariant ones first.
   - The kinds of the parameters of a handler are a list beside the list
     of parameters ([hm_params_kinds]), where the compiler pairs each
     parameter with its kind ([Bound_parameter.t]). Code has no such
     list: the kinds of its parameters are those of its parameter arity,
     unarized ([code_params_kinds]); in the compiler the two are kept
     equal by construction. The compiler has no term in which the list
     of kinds and the list of parameters differ in length; here there
     are such terms, and nothing yet says that they are not well-formed.
   - A primitive application is a primitive with a list of arguments, where
     [Flambda_primitive.t] holds the arguments by arity. A primitive
     applied to the wrong number of arguments has no value
     (FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.v).
   - [Project_value_slot] and [Project_function_slot], unary primitives in
     the compiler, are forms of [named] of their own, as their meaning is
     fixed by that of closures.
   - A set of closures has two presentations. [Set_of_closures] and
     [Static_const_set_of_closures] are a set of one function, whose
     function slot is not named; [Project_value_slot] projects from a
     closure whatever function slot it is at. [Closure_of_set] and
     [Static_const_closure_of_set] are a set of any number of functions,
     each at a named function slot; [Project_value_slot_from] is the
     compiler's projection of a value slot, which names the function slot
     of the closure it projects from ([project_from]).
   - A [Let] binds one variable. The compiler's [Let] of a set of closures
     binds one variable to each closure of the set
     ([Bound_pattern.Set_of_closures]); here it is [let_closures]: a [Let]
     of the first closure, and for each other closure a [Let] of its
     projection from the first. Closures have no identity, so this is the
     same.
   - Likewise a [Let_static] binds one symbol to each closure of a static
     set by a [Bind_symbol] of its own, which repeats the set and says
     which symbols its other closures are bound to; the compiler binds
     them all with one pattern ([Bound_static.Pattern.Set_of_closures]).
   - Of the names in the forms of a set, a renaming acts on the variables
     only: those of the value slots and of the closure projected from,
     and the variables that [let_closures] binds, each by a [Let].
     Function slots and value slots are not renamed, here or in the
     compiler. Nor are the code ids of the functions and the symbols of
     the closures of a static set, like every code id and symbol of the
     model: the compiler's [Bound_pattern.Static] does not permute the
     names it binds either.
   - The callee of an [Apply] is always given, where the compiler may omit
     it for a direct call.
   - The exception continuation of an [Apply] is two fields, the handler
     and the extra arguments with their kinds, where the compiler has an
     [Exn_continuation.t].
   - The numbers in constants are integers: those of the floats and
     vectors are bit patterns, as in the compiler. No type here
     restricts one to its range, nor a tag, nor any other number of a
     term: FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.v says what the ranges are, and
     FlambdaWellFormedSpec.numbers_in_range is the check that every
     number of a term is in its range. *)
