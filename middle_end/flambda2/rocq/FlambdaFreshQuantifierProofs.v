(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaFreshQuantifierSpec.v. Nothing here
   needs review.

   Each law that needs no support is proved by putting two finite sets
   together, or by taking a name outside one with [fresh_name]. Each law
   that needs a support goes through the agreement of the three readings
   ([some_any]), whose proof is one swap: a name outside the support at
   which the predicate holds is exchanged for any other name outside
   it. *)
