(* Symbols that a unit imports, and telling exceptions apart by name.

   This is a prototype, to be agreed with the owners of the files it
   touches before it is a request for a change:
   requests/C5-imported-symbols.md.

   This file is to be reviewed: [imports_statics] and [unit_refines];
   [prefix_refines_statement], of two terms that follow one group of
   static bindings; the seven statements of what a primitive does with
   an imported symbol, against FlambdaValueSpec.imported_of,
   is_imported_pointer and identity_of and
   FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.eval_phys_equal; the two statements of a unit
   whose imports are of the classes of identities and of data, with
   the two functions that the first is stated with, against
   FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.eval_phys_equal and
   FlambdaHeapSpec.eval_phys_equal_location; the two
   examples, against what the front end makes of a handler that matches
   an exception (lambda/matching.ml, [combine_extension_constructor]);
   and the example of an import of which nothing is known.

   A unit mentions symbols that it does not bind. The first that the
   front end makes are the predefined exceptions: a division tests its
   divisor and raises [Division_by_zero], a checked access raises
   [Invalid_argument], a match that is not exhaustive raises
   [Match_failure], and a handler that catches an exception by name
   compares what it caught with the symbol of the exception
   ([Closure_conversion], at [Pgetpredef], makes the symbol; it is of a
   compilation unit of its own, [Compilation_unit.predef_exn]). The
   symbols of other units are the same case.

   In the model such a symbol is bound, in the static environment that
   the unit starts with, to [Static_imported] of a class. An import of
   the class [Import_identity] is an object with an identity, which is
   its symbol: an exception. One of the class [Import_data] is an
   object that another unit allocated and that is not an identity. One
   of the class [Import_unknown] is a value of which nothing is known:
   it may be a tagged immediate, an identity or an object, mutable or
   not. The model knows the contents of none. So:
   - [Phys_equal] tells an identity from everything else: two
     identities are the same when they are one symbol, and an identity
     is not a tagged immediate, an allocated value of the unit or an
     import that is data ([phys_equal_identities_statement],
     [phys_equal_imported_immediate_statement],
     [phys_equal_identity_other_statement]);
   - an import that is data is as an immutable allocated value is: it
     is not a tagged immediate, and [Phys_equal] has no value on it
     against an allocated value, another import that is data, or itself
     ([phys_equal_data_import_statement]);
   - an import of which nothing is known is compared with nothing:
     [Phys_equal] has no value on it against any value, itself
     included ([phys_equal_unknown_import_statement]). What tells the
     two other classes from it is [is_imported_pointer], which is
     [is_imported] of a value that is not an import of this class
     ([imported_pointer_statement]). Where the static environment has
     no import of this class the comparison, and that of the machine
     with a heap against a location, are the functions written with
     [is_imported] ([phys_equal_two_classes_statement]); and a unit
     whose imports are of the two other classes is run in such
     environments only ([unit_two_classes_statement]);
   - no other primitive reads an import of any class: of the unary
     and binary primitives only [Opaque_identity], which returns it,
     and [Phys_equal] have a value on it
     ([imported_not_read_statement]). It may be an argument of a
     continuation or of a call, a field of a block, and what a unit
     returns or raises ([unknown_import_statement] is an example of
     the third class);
   - a static binding of the unit cannot bind it again: the machine is
     undefined on a symbol bound twice
     (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.eval_static_bindings).

   That is enough for a handler that catches a constant exception by
   name, whether what was raised is a constant exception or a block,
   and one that catches an exception with arguments where what was
   raised is a block ([catches_by_name_statement],
   [catches_with_argument_statement]).

   What it leaves undefined, and a program does. An exception with
   arguments is a block whose first field is the exception; a constant
   exception is the exception itself. A handler tests its constant
   cases first, by comparing what it caught with each; if none is it
   and the handler has a case for an exception with arguments, or one
   for any exception that comes after such a case, it loads the first
   field of what it caught. So when it has caught a constant exception
   that is none of its constant cases, it loads a field of an imported
   symbol (the name of the exception: the object is a block of tag 248
   with the name and a number, [Cmm_helpers.predef_exception]). That
   load has no value here: the last part of
   [catches_with_argument_statement].

   CR mshinwell: a handler whose cases are for exceptions with
   arguments, such as [Failure _] alone, is undefined in the model when
   what it catches is a constant predefined exception, such as
   [Not_found]: the handler loads field 0 of the symbol, and the model
   knows no contents of an imported symbol. The compiled code reads the
   name of the exception there and goes on to the next case. To give it
   a meaning an identity must have contents (for a predefined
   exception, a string and a number) that a load reads and that no
   other observation does; a unit that declares an exception makes the
   same object, a block of tag 248 marked [Immutable_unique], which
   needs the heap (requests/C4-heap.md, "Later: symbols as addresses").
   It is wrong only in that nothing is proved of such a program. *)

   refine each other from the first environment exactly when the two
