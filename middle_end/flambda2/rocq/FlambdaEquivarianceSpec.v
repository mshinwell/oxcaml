(* Equivariance: renamings act on everything a state is made of, and
   execution commutes with them.

   This file is to be reviewed: the action on what a state holds
   ([rename_cont_value] and the definitions after it), and the
   statements.

   FlambdaNominalSpec.v has the renamings and their action on terms
   ([rename_expr]), code included: the compiler renames code as it
   renames everything else ([apply_renaming_static_const_or_code],
   [Code0.apply_renaming], [apply_renaming_function_params_and_body]).
   Here the action is extended to what a state holds:
   - a value holds no variable and no continuation (closures hold code
     ids and values), so a renaming does nothing to a value, and no
     action on values is written;
   - an environment has its variables renamed
     (FlambdaAlphaSpec.rename_env);
   - a continuation closure has its handler, its environments and the
     handlers defined with it renamed, and a way out of the term is
     renamed, as it is observed;
   - the static environment has its code renamed. Symbols, code ids and
     slots are fixed by the action;
   - a state, the result of a step and a behaviour are renamed
     componentwise. The continuation of an exit is renamed.

   The statements:
   - the action on states is that of a group;
   - a step, a run and the behaviour of a state commute with it
     ([step_equivariant_statement], [run_equivariant_statement],
     [behaves_equivariant_statement]). They hold of every state and have
     no premise: nothing is asked of the code, which need not be
     closed. The renaming has to go into code for this: a call takes the
     parameters, [my_closure] and the two continuations out of the code
     and binds them in the environments
     (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.call_function);
   - so equivalence and refinement, of states and of expressions, are
     preserved by renaming, and a renaming that fixes the continuations
     through which a state leaves gives an equivalent state
     ([renamed_state_equivalent_statement]);
   - two rewrites of FlambdaNormaliseSpec.v commute with renaming: one
     that looks at one construct at a time ([fold_constants]), and
     inlining, which itself renames ([inline_calls]).

   What of the compiler this is. The action is that of the compiler's
   renamings that are permutations of variables and of continuations
   within one compilation unit: those made by [Renaming.add_variable],
   [add_fresh_variable], [add_continuation], [add_fresh_continuation]
   and [compose] from [Renaming.empty], which is what the freshening of
   a binder uses (the freshening of a static binder permutes no symbol
   and no code id: [Bound_pattern.renaming], at [Static]). It is not
   that of a renaming with an import map or with maps of bound names
   ([Renaming.create_import_map], used when the terms and types of
   another unit are read). Such a renaming can replace symbols and code
   ids, takes the value slots that are not used out of a set of
   closures ([Set_of_closures.apply_renaming]), may only be the first
   argument of [compose], and has no inverse: it is not a permutation,
   and the statements here about the identity, composition, inverses
   and execution say nothing of it. It is another operation, which this
   file does not model.

   Other differences from the compiler: [apply_renaming] takes the term
   first there and the renaming first here, so that it can be mapped
   over a list. The compiler delays a renaming at each name abstraction
   and composes the delayed ones; here it is applied at once, so a term
   here and the compiler's agree in what [pattern_match] shows of them
   up to the fresh names it chooses, and not as trees.

   A renaming is a list of swaps, and two lists may be the same
   permutation: the laws of a group hold of the action, not of the
   lists.

   Nothing is trusted here. The proofs are in FlambdaEquivarianceProofs.v,
   which needs no review. *)
