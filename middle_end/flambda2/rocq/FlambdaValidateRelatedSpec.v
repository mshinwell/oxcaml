(* A second check of a unit against the unit it came from, for the
   units whose exits a lifting changes.

   This file awaits the human's confirmation (decision D43). What it
   proves of the check is not [refines]; whether it is what a verdict
   is to mean is the human's to decide, between this form and a
   structural one (below, "What that is, and is not"). The test tool
   asks the check only of a unit that it reports as not validated, and
   prints what the check accepts on a line of its own, which has not
   the word "validated": such a unit stays not validated, and is in no
   count of the units validated.

   This file is to be reviewed: the definitions and the statements.

   FlambdaValidateSpec.validate_unit answers [Same_once_lifted] of a
   unit only where each lifting passes its test of the exits
   (FlambdaLiftSpec.exits_plain): a lifting gives a symbol where the
   unit before gave the value that it lifts
   (FlambdaLiftSpec.lift_named), and FlambdaSemanticsSpec.refines asks
   of two exits the same values. A unit that exits with something that
   Simplify lifted is so refused.

   The check here follows the two comparisons of lifted terms of
   [validate_unit], with the liftings made without that test
   (FlambdaLiftObservedSpec.with_lifting_observed), and concludes
   another relation: not [refines], but that an exit of the unit
   before is answered by an exit of the unit after that nothing which
   may follow a unit tells apart from it
   (FlambdaObserversSpec.worlds_observed), and that the unit after
   ends only if the unit before exits or goes wrong. Of a unit before
   that goes wrong it says nothing. Neither relation is said to give
   the other: [refines] does not compare the static environments that
   two exits leave, under which what may follow is run here; and two
   exits related here need not have the same values, nor heaps that
   hold the same.

   What that is, and is not. What may follow a unit
   (FlambdaObserversSpec.observer) is a way out, or a handler with no
   environment of its own, which binds nothing static and names no
   symbol and no code id, and which projects none of the value slots
   that the check is given to remove; it may read, store, allocate,
   project and call. The two statements are over that whole class,
   [observer slots] at the value slots given, and over no smaller
   one; a handler that makes an immutable array is in it. Their
   relations are those of FlambdaObserversSpec.v over
   every observer, which are the relations of a class at that class
   (FlambdaObserversSpec.worlds_observed_by_observer_statement,
   FlambdaObserversSpec.refines_observed_by_observer_statement). With
   a term more in the language there are observers more, and the two
   statements then conclude more. So nothing is said here of two
   units that are linked: a unit that follows another names its
   symbols. Nor does what may follow name an import: of two exits
   that each carry an imported symbol, a predefined exception for
   one, alone or inside a block, it is not said that it is the same
   symbol. Two exits so related have
   the same constants and the same locations among their values, and
   heaps that bind the same locations
   (FlambdaObserversSpec.worlds_observed_way_out_statement); of an
   allocated value at an exit, only what such a handler can come to
   observe of it is compared. Whether this is what a verdict on a
   pass that changes values is to mean has not been decided: the
   other form would relate the values of the two exits and every
   entry of the two memories structurally. The verdict has a type of
   its own ([related_validation]) and is no [validation]. The check
   does not ask what [validate_unit] answers of the two terms: it is
   the tool that asks it only of a unit not validated.

   The route. The unit before is prepared as [validate_unit] prepares
   it; each lifting given is applied without the test of the exits
   and followed by FlambdaValidateSpec.normalise_lifted, and after
   the last the known value slots are read and what is known is used
   after the demotion, as there ([lifted_in_turn_observed]); the calls
   are taken on and the term tidied as there; the value slots given
   and then the static bindings given are removed
   (FlambdaValidateSpec.without_slots,
   FlambdaValidateSpec.without_statics). The unit after is normalised
   and tidied and the unused static bindings of its head are removed,
   as there. The two are then compared as there, twice: with the code
   of the unit after bound first, up to the order of the static
   bindings and the place of the code; and, if that fails, with the
   static bindings of both that need nothing from around them bound
   first (FlambdaValidateSpec.with_statics_first).

   The unit is run from the static environment of its imports
   (FlambdaImportsSpec.imports_statics). The check computes what the
   laws of the steps ask of that environment, as
   FlambdaValidateImportsSpec.lifted_holds_from does for
   [validate_unit]: that it binds no name that a lifting or the use
   of what is known binds ([lifted_observed_free_in]), nor a name of
   the head of the unit after where bindings are removed from it
   (FlambdaValidateImportsSpec.head_removal_free_in), nor, for the
   second comparison, a name that either term compared binds
   (FlambdaValidateImportsSpec.statics_first_free_in). It also asks
   that the code of the two units be closed
   (FlambdaBindersSpec.code_closed): the passage from the form in
   which the steps are proved to the statement about the two units
   run on their own needs it
   (FlambdaObserversSpec.under_observers_worlds_statement).

   The proofs are in FlambdaValidateRelatedProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
