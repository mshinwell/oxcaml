(* Rewriting inside a handler or inside the body of code, where the
   rewrite is sound only from the states that it can be run from.

   This file is to be reviewed: [kept_by_step], [handler_refines_from],
   [code_refines_from] and the statements.

   FlambdaContextSpec.v says that a rewrite which is a refinement under
   all environments may be applied under any binder. Most rewrites of
   the simplifier are not: they are sound because of what is known of
   the state in which the rewritten expression runs. Here that is a
   predicate on states [inv] that a step keeps ([kept_by_step]), so that
   a run from a state that has it stays among the states that have it.
   Examples are a condition on the static environment that its
   extensions keep (what a symbol is bound to), that every number of
   the state is in range (FlambdaRangeSpec.state_in_range), and their
   conjunction.

   A handler, and the body of code, do not run where they are written:
   they are kept, and run later, any number of times, under the
   variables of that place with the parameters bound. So the premise on
   the two expressions is about every state in which they can come to
   run:

   - a handler runs under the variables of its definition with its
     parameters bound to some values, under any continuations and any
     static environment. The application of a handler has no step unless
     the values are of the kinds that the handler gives its parameters
     (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.apply_cont_value), so that fact is given too
     ([handler_refines_from]);
   - the body of code runs at a call, under its parameters and
     [my_closure] alone, bound to the arguments and the callee, with its
     two continuations bound and under any static environment. A call
     has no step unless the arguments are of the kinds of the arity of
     the code (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.call_function), and the callee is a
     closure, so those two facts are given too ([code_refines_from]).
     They are about the values: nothing is asked of the kinds that the
     term gives.

   In such a state the premise asks two things. The first expression,
   if its state has [inv], refines the second: this is the rewrite, and
   it is asked only from the states that have [inv]. And the two states
   have [inv] together. The second is not there because a run could
   leave the states that have [inv]: a step keeps it, and the
   statements ask it of both whole states. It is what the proof needs.
   The proof compares the runs of the two whole states through states
   that neither need reach, the first expression under the handlers and
   code of the rewritten term, and the second under those of the
   original; [inv] of such a state is got from [inv] of the state with
   the other expression under the same environments, which one of the
   runs does reach. A predicate that does not look at the expression
   of a state, such as a condition on the static environment, meets the
   second for free.

   The kinds of the values of the parameters of a handler are given, as
   those of the arguments of a call are. The machine tests the kind of a
   value where a handler binds it, as it does at a call (the review
   comment before FlambdaSemanticsSpec.step says how certain the first
   is). So [handler_refines_from] takes the kinds that the handler gives
   its parameters, and hands the premise that the values are of those
   kinds. Both are about the values, in the state where the expression
   comes to run.

   The statements are of states, not of expressions under all
   environments: the two whole states are asked to have [inv] at the
   start.

   - [let_cont_handler_refines_from_statement]: the handler of a
     non-recursive [Let_cont].
   - [let_cont_recursive_handler_refines_from_statement]: one handler
     of a recursive [Let_cont]. As in FlambdaContextSpec.v, the two
     handlers must agree on whether they bind something static.
   - [let_static_code_refines_from_statement]: the body of code bound by
     a [Let_static], with the same condition.
   - [let_static_code_refines_where_statement]: the last, for a
     condition [ok] on the static environment that extensions keep. The
     body need only refine at a call: under its parameters bound to
     values of the kinds of its arity and [my_closure] to a value of
     kind [Value], and a static environment of which [ok] holds. This
     is FlambdaStaticSpec.let_static_code_refines_statement with the
     premise weakened to where the code runs.
   - That the premises can be met: for the predicate that holds of
     every state they are a refinement in every state in which the
     expressions run ([handler_refines_from_always_statement],
     [code_refines_from_always_statement]). And for a predicate that
     looks at the expression, that of the runs in range, which a step
     keeps (FlambdaRangeSpec.step_in_range_statement): two handlers
     that pass the check of numbers have it together
     ([handler_refines_from_in_range_statement]), so in a run in range
     a handler may be replaced by one that passes the check and that
     it refines from the states in range
     ([let_cont_handler_refines_in_range_statement]).

   Nothing is trusted here. The proofs are in
   FlambdaContextWhereProofs.v, which needs no review; they are
   instances of one lemma of FlambdaContextProofs.v, by which a run
   under some environments is carried to environments that hold
   rewritten handlers and code. *)

   it has [inv], refines the second.

   That the two have [inv] together is asked for the proof. It goes
   through states that no run of the two whole states need reach (the
   first expression under the rewritten handlers and code, the second
   under the original ones), where that a step keeps [inv] gives
   nothing, and it gets [inv] of such a state from [inv] of the state
   with the other expression. It is not that a run could leave the
   states that have [inv]. *)
