(* In the code of a closure that is a symbol, [my_closure] is the symbol.

   This file is to be reviewed: [bind_my_closures], against what Simplify
   does (below); [only_closure_of], the check; and the statements.

   What Simplify does. It simplifies the code of a function where it
   simplifies the set of closures that the function is of, and gives
   [my_closure], in that code, the type of an alias of the name that the
   closure is bound to (simplify/simplify_set_of_closures.ml,
   [dacc_inside_function], the case [Some function_slot]:
   [T.alias_type_of K.value (Simple.name name)]). Where the set is
   static, or has just been lifted (FlambdaLiftSpec.v), that name is the
   symbol of the closure, and every use of [my_closure] in the code
   becomes the symbol: a recursive function calls itself through its
   symbol. That is right only where the code so simplified runs for
   that closure and for no other. It is not inferred here from the new
   code ids that Simplify gives: there is one new id for each old one
   across the sets simplified together
   (simplify/simplify_set_of_closures_context.ml,
   [compute_old_to_new_code_ids_all_sets]), so sets that had the same
   code have the same new code. It is a condition, checked
   ([only_closure_of], below).

   What is here. [bind_my_closures known e] puts, at the head of the
   code of each code id that [known] gives a symbol,

     Let my_closure = Symbol s in body

   so that [my_closure] is from there on an alias of the symbol;
   following the alias and removing the [Let] are other passes
   (../types/rocq/FlambdaAliasesSpec.follow_aliases,
   FlambdaNormaliseSpec.remove_unused_lets, taken into code by
   FlambdaNormaliseSpec.rewrite_code). Code one of whose parameters is
   named as its [my_closure] is left alone: the parameter is what the
   name means there.

   It is right only if the closure called is the symbol whenever that
   code runs. Nothing in the model makes that so: a code id may be the
   code of several closures (FlambdaWellFormedSpec.v: two sets of a unit
   may have the same code), and under other environments the code may be
   called through a closure that was there already. So this is no
   rewrite under all environments. For a unit run on its own it is
   enough that the unit makes one closure only of the code, the static
   one bound to the symbol, which is what [only_closure_of id s e]
   checks: no [Let] of [e] makes a closure of a set that has the code
   [id], in code and in handlers too, and a static binding of a closure
   whose code is [id] binds [s]. A unit that passes calls the code [id]
   through [s] only ([only_closure_sound_statement]).

   Which code ids, and which symbols, is a guess of the caller's;
   nothing is believed of it. The rewrite is used by
   FlambdaLiftSpec.lift_unit, with the lifting of [Let]s, and it is
   there that it is said to refine the unit
   (FlambdaLiftSpec.lift_unit_program_refines_statement): after the
   [Let] of a closure is lifted, its code is that of one closure, the
   symbol.

   The proofs are in FlambdaMyClosureProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
