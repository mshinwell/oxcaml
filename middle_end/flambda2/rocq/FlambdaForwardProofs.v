(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaForwardSpec.v. Nothing here needs
   review.

   The pass changes the applications of a continuation on the strength
   of its handler, so it is not a rewrite of two expressions on their
   own; and where the first term applies a continuation whose handler
   applies another, the second applies that other at once. The term and
   its result are run side by side by rounds
   (FlambdaRoundsProofs.rounds_refines): a round is one step of each,
   but for such an application, where the first run takes the steps
   through the handlers and the second one step. The relation between
   the two states ([state_fwd]) is:

   - the second expression is the first with some applications replaced
     by the [Apply_cont] of the handler of their continuation, the
     arguments put for the parameters ([fwd], [goes]), as the entries of
     some [forwards] say; no binder in scope binds a name that an entry
     depends on;
   - the variables of the two states are the same;
   - each continuation name stands, in the two states, for the same
     thing or for closures whose handlers are so related, under the same
     variables and continuations in turn so related ([cont_fwd]);
   - for each entry, the name stands in the second state for a closure
     whose handler is the [Apply_cont] of the entry; the variables of the
     state agree with those of that closure on the variables that the
     [Apply_cont] reads, and the continuation that it applies is the same
     in the state as in the closure ([held]).

   The round at an application that goes on ([cont_fwd_rounds]) is by
   induction on how the closures are related: the handler of the first
   closure is an application that the handler of the second is related
   to, itself the same or one that goes on.

   A call of the second term may return to the continuation that the
   handler of the return continuation of the first passes its
   parameters on to ([returns]). What the callee is given to return to
   is then, in the first run, a continuation related to the closure of
   an entry and, in the second, what that closure applies
   ([Alias_fwd]). Results given to the first reach, after the steps
   through the handlers, what answers the same results given to the
   second: it is the round of an application that goes on, with the
   parameters themselves for arguments. So a round at a call or at an
   application of related continuations is some steps of the first
   run to one of the second. The relation between continuations has a
   flag for whether such a pair is allowed; a name that has an entry
   never stands for one, as the round of an application that goes on
   needs the closure of the entry.

   The relation is taken with a flag ([strict]). Without it, the second
   run answers the first where the first is defined, which is the
   refinement. With it, an application that goes on has arguments
   that are known, by the binders around it, to have the kinds that
   the handler of its continuation gives its parameters, as many as
   the handler has parameters; the first run then takes its step there
   too, the second run is undefined where the first is, and a round is
   read the other way too ([fwd_round_back]).
   FlambdaForwardJumpsProofs.v and FlambdaForwardKindedProofs.v make
   equivalences of that. For it the relation carries the kinds of the
   variables bound around a point and those that the handlers of the
   continuations bound around it give their parameters
   (FlambdaNormaliseSpec.kinds_in_scope, [kinds_of_conts]), and the
   two states have variables of those kinds
   (FlambdaNormaliseProofs.kinds_hold). *)
