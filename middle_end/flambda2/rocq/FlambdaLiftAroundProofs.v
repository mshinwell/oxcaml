(* Proofs for FlambdaLiftAroundSpec.v. Nothing here needs review.

   The two runs are in step, but that where a group is put the second
   run takes a step more, to bind it. The second expression is the
   first with its [Let]s made aliases and its groups put; values are
   related by FlambdaLiftSpec.value_lifted, and the static environments
   as in FlambdaLiftFromCodeProofs.v with no code rewritten. Beside
   that the states have what the check has gone by: constants that are
   known ([known_valid]: each symbol is bound, in the second run, to
   what its constant is in the variables of the second run as they are
   now), for which the check passes of the expression; and the same of
   every handler that a continuation keeps, in the variables that it
   keeps. A step that binds a variable keeps what the check kept
   ([forget]). So where a [Let] that is made an alias is executed, the
   symbol is bound to the constant of the [Let] evaluated in the
   variables of that moment, which is what the [Let] makes, lifted.

   The second run is that of a well-formed unit: it never binds a
   symbol twice (FlambdaWellFormedProofs.well_formed_never_faults) and
   reads no variable that has no value
   (FlambdaWellFormedProofs.well_formed_names_bound), so a group that is
   put is evaluated. That the values at the exit are equal is from the
   invariant of the first run that FlambdaLiftProofs.v has for the
   check of the exits ([plain_state]). *)
