(* Loopify: the self tail calls of a function become jumps to a recursive
   continuation around its body. A rewrite of the term before Simplify,
   which refines it.

   This file is to be reviewed: [loopify_unit] and what it is made of,
   which are extracted and run by the validation of
   middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/, and the statement.

   What Simplify does. The front end marks a function for it
   (from_lambda/closure_conversion.ml: [Default_loopify_and_tailrec] for a
   single recursive function whose recursive calls are all in tail
   position, [Always_loopify] for [@loop]; terms/loopify_attribute.ml,
   [should_loopify]). For such code, simplify/simplify_set_of_closures.ml
   ([simplify_function_body]) makes a continuation, [self], and
   simplify/simplify_expr.ml ([simplify_function_body], the case
   [Loopify]) simplifies, in place of the body,

     let_cont rec self (params) = body in cont self (params)

   with the parameters of the code, and their kinds, as those of the
   continuation. In it,
   simplify/simplify_apply_expr.ml ([loopify_decision_for_call], then
   [simplify_self_tail_call]) makes a call an [Apply_cont] of [self] to
   the arguments of the call when
   - its callee is, up to aliases, the [my_closure] of the code;
   - its return continuation is that of the code (or it never returns);
   - its exception continuation is that of the code, with no extra
     arguments.
   So a call counts as a tail call by where it returns, and nothing else
   is asked: not that the call names the code, not its region (see the
   CR at [is_self_tail_call]). The call is a full application of known
   code by then: Simplify makes the decision in
   [simplify_direct_full_application], and takes a call with fewer or
   more arguments than the code has parameters for a partial application
   or an over-application first ([simplify_direct_function_call]).

   What [loopify_unit] does. For each code that a [Let_static] of the
   term binds and whose code id is in the list given, with a
   continuation name for [self], it replaces the code by
   [looped_code], if [loopable] holds of it, and leaves it alone
   otherwise. The conditions, all checked:
   - [my_closure] is not a parameter, and no [Let] or handler of the
     body binds it ([loop_safe]): then a callee that is [Var my_closure]
     is the closure the code was called with;
   - no name is two of the parameters (FlambdaMapSpec.distinct): the
     loop is entered by a jump to [self] with the parameters as its
     arguments, and the handler of [self] has no step unless their
     values are of the kinds of the parameters
     (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.apply_cont_value). Were one name two
     parameters of different kinds, both would have the value of the
     second at the jump, which would then have no step where the call
     had one;
   - no [Let_cont] of the body binds the return or the exception
     continuation of the code ([loop_safe]): then a call that returns
     to them returns where the code does;
   - [self] is neither of those two, and does not occur in the body,
     bound or applied ([loop_safe]);
   - some call was made a jump (FlambdaUnusedContsSpec.cont_free_b of
     [self]): Simplify does not keep a loop that nothing jumps to.
   A self tail call ([is_self_tail_call]) is an [Apply] whose callee is
   [Var my_closure], whose two continuations are those of the code, the
   exception continuation with no extra arguments, and which is made at
   an arity of as many components as the code has parameters. With extra
   arguments, an exception of the body would reach the handler with them
   after the call and without them after the jump. With fewer or more
   components the call is a partial application or an over-application
   (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.shape_of_closure_call, which compares the same
   two lengths), which does not run the body with the arguments of the
   call, so the jump would not refine it.
   What is not asked, and why it is right without:
   - the call kind. A direct call that names other code than that of the
     closure is undefined (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.shape_of_closure_call),
     so anything refines it;
   - the kinds of the arguments of the call, and that its arities are
     those of the code. A full call that does not agree with the code in
     them is undefined (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.call_code), so the jump,
     which tests the kinds of its arguments against those of the
     parameters and their number, refines it; with the wrong number of
     arguments the jump is undefined as the call is;
   - that the callee has been proved to be this code: the closure a
     piece of code is called with is a closure of that code, by how a
     call finds the code.

   Why it is right: a self tail call runs the body again with the
   parameters bound to the arguments, [my_closure] to the same closure,
   and the same two continuations; there is no stack to push
   (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.call_code). The jump runs the looped body
   with the parameters rebound, under the variables and continuations of
   the first entry, where [my_closure] and the two continuations are the
   same. So the two runs go step for step, but at the entry of the code,
   where the looped code takes two more steps to bind [self] and jump
   to it.

   The statement ([loopify_unit_refines_statement]) is refinement under
   all environments. The list is a guess of the caller, and the check
   fails closed: code that is not [loopable] is not changed. The name
   for [self] is given by the caller too, and checked.
   FlambdaNameAbstractionSpec.fresh_name makes a name outside a list of
   names; taking [self] from it, over the continuations of the body,
   would spare the caller the guess, and may replace it.

   Regions and depths. The model has no regions, so the rewrite says
   nothing of the region that a self tail call passes for its result,
   which Simplify does not compare with the function's (the CR at
   [is_self_tail_call]). The depth variable of the call ([my_depth],
   [next_depth]) is dropped by the conversion to the model, as
   everywhere.

   Renaming: [loop_calls] compares names by equality only; [looped_code]
   binds the name given for [self], so it commutes with a renaming that
   is applied to that name too. That statement is owed to the nominal
   work and is not made here.

   The proofs are in FlambdaLoopifyProofs.v, which needs no review. *)

(* CR mshinwell: a self tail call passes the region for its result
   ([Apply.return_mode]) and has a position; Simplify's
   [loopify_decision_for_call] compares neither with the function's, and
   the model has no regions, so this rewrite says nothing about them. A
   trial from source found no call that passes the three tests with a
   return mode other than the function's own region parameters: the type
   checker refuses a local-returning call in tail position outside an
   exclave, and the conversion from Lambda gives a call the function's
   return continuation only where no region that the function opened is
   still open. The position can differ ([@nontail] inside an exclave),
   which looks harmless. Discrepancy V4-1. *)
