(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaHoistCodeSpec.v. Nothing here
   needs review.

   Two things are kept along the run of a unit that passes the checks.
   The closures that its terms make are of code that is bound, as more
   and more code is bound ([terms_in_scope]), so the closures that its
   values hold are (FlambdaSemanticsProofs.step_values_all). And no
   code id is bound twice (the invariant of
   FlambdaWellFormedProofs.v). The unit and the unit with its code
   first are then run side by side, in step, with the same values: the
   second state is the first with the bindings of code taken out of its
   terms and all the code bound ([hoist_state]). A call finds its code
   in both, because the closure called is of code that the first run
   has bound; a group of static bindings binds its symbols in both,
   because the first run does not stop on the code of the group.

   The two runs may start from a continuation environment of what may
   follow a unit (FlambdaObserversSpec.observers), the empty one for
   the statements of a unit run on its own. What may follow a unit
   binds no code, so the second state has it as it is
   ([observers_hoist]); it names no code id, so the closures that it
   makes are of code that is bound, whatever is bound
   ([observers_in_scope]); and it keeps no value. *)
