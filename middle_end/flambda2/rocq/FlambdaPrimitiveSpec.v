(* What the primitives of FlambdaPrimitiveModel.v compute, their kinds,
   and the laws that every primitive obeys.

   This file is to be reviewed: [eval_prim] and what it is made of, against
   middle_end/flambda2/terms/flambda_primitive.mli for what each primitive
   is, and against middle_end/flambda2/simplify/simplify_unary_primitive.ml,
   simplify_binary_primitive.ml, simplify_variadic_primitive.ml and
   number_adjuncts.ml for what Simplify takes each to compute; the kinds,
   against [arg_kind_of_unary_primitive], [args_kind_of_binary_primitive],
   [args_kind_of_variadic_primitive] and the [result_kind_of_] functions
   of flambda_primitive.ml; and the statements at the end.

   [eval_prim statics p vs] is the value of the primitive [p] applied to
   the values [vs], if it has one. Where it has none the term is
   undefined (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v), and a transformation may do
   anything to it. A primitive has no value
   - when it is not given as many arguments as it takes;
   - when an argument is not of the kind it takes: this is what Simplify
     assumes, which replaces a primitive applied to an argument of the
     wrong kind by [Invalid] ([Simplify_primitive.arg_kind_mismatch]);
   - when an argument is not what the primitive is for, even if of the
     right kind: the cases are listed at each primitive below. Most are
     there because Simplify assumes that the case does not arise, where
     the machine would compute something;
   - when it computes with an integer that is out of the range of its
     kind;
   - when an argument is a symbol that is bound to nothing
     ([eval_prim_symbols_bound_statement]): any operation on such a
     symbol is undefined, and a well-formed term has none.

   The integers. The model is of a 64-bit target: the tagged and the
   naked immediates are OCaml's [int], of 63 bits, and the other kinds
   have 8, 16, 32 and 64 bits ([int_width]). A constant holds any integer
   (FlambdaModel.v); the arithmetic, the comparisons, tagging and
   untagging take only integers in the range of their kind
   ([int_of_value]), and their results are in range. Arithmetic is on
   mathematical integers and wraps ([wrap]), which is two's complement.

   Numbers in range. The compiler's numbers are of types that hold a
   range only, and the model's are integers. The section "Numbers in
   range" says which integers the compiler's are: a constant of each
   kind ([const_in_range]), the tag of a block ([tag_in_range]), the
   numbers that a primitive carries ([prim_in_range]), and a value all
   of whose numbers are such ([value_in_range]). A unit that passes the
   check FlambdaWellFormedSpec.numbers_in_range has no other, and no
   primitive makes one ([eval_prim_in_range_statement]), so the run of
   such a unit never meets one (FlambdaRangeSpec.v).
   FlambdaPrimitiveProofs.v shows that the results of arithmetic are in
   range, that at 64 bits [wrap], [unsigned] and [in_range] are the
   [wrap64], [unsigned64] and [fits_int64] of rocq/OxCamlInt64.v, and
   that at 63 bits addition, subtraction and multiplication are those of
   OCaml's [int] as rocq/OxCamlInt.v models it.

   Allocated values are read through the observations of
   FlambdaValueSpec.v ([block_of], ...), which look through a symbol to
   what it is bound to. So the value of a primitive may depend on the
   static environment, but only on what the symbols among its arguments
   are bound to ([eval_prim_static_values_statement]).

   The laws. The rest of the model does not look inside a primitive: it
   uses the statements at the end, which hold of every primitive.
   [eval_prim] is opaque after FlambdaPrimitiveProofs.v, as [step] is, so
   that no proof elsewhere comes to depend on which primitives there are.
   A proof about one primitive rewrites with the equation of its arity
   there ([eval_prim_unary], [eval_prim_binary], [eval_prim_variadic]).
   The last law says that the value of a primitive on its arguments is
   its value on arguments that the observations read alike
   ([eval_prim_related_statement]): a block made by a primitive and a
   symbol bound to an equal block, for one.

   The proofs are in FlambdaPrimitiveProofs.v, which needs no review. *)

   [Swap_byte_endianness] puts the bytes of an integer in the opposite

     of the kind whose bytes are those of the argument in the opposite

   wrapped too, so that every result is in range by its form; that
   changes nothing but an [Lsr] by 0, which is the integer shifted and
   not its unsigned reading (FlambdaPrimitiveProofs.v,
   [eval_int_shift_asr] and [eval_int_shift_lsr]). *)
(* CR mshinwell: [Int_shift] has no value on an amount that is negative,

   folds one to zero ([Number_adjuncts.with_shift]), where the machine
   shifts by the amount modulo the size of the register on x86-64, so
   the two differ: on a shift by 64, which the machine does not do at
   all, and on an arithmetic shift right of a negative number.
   For the naked immediates the bound is 63, where it is 64 for the
   tagged ones, which are the same integers: Simplify folds a shift
   right by 63 of a negative naked immediate to 0 and the machine gives
   -1 (C1-9). The library documents that amount as unspecified for the
   untagged [int] and as specified for [int]. No value is what the

   know the field, when it reads it whatever the tag; it does not use

   The mutability of the load is not looked at. It says what the

   immutable, so that a load marked [Mutable] from one, which is what

(* A unary primitive applied to a value.
   - [Get_tag] is the tag of a block, and has no value on anything else,
     a closure, a boxed number and a string included: Simplify takes its
     argument to be a variant that is not null
     ([Flambda2_types.add_get_tag_relation]).
   - [String_length] is the number of bytes of an immutable string, and
     has no value on anything else: Simplify makes it [Invalid] where
     its argument cannot be a string
     ([Simplify_unary_primitive.simplify_string_length]). A string so
     long that its length is not a naked immediate has none; the
     compiler has no such string.
   - [Opaque_identity] is the identity, on a value of the kind it
     carries that is not a symbol bound to nothing.
   - [Box_number] makes a boxed number of a naked number of the kind it
     carries, and [Unbox_number] is the naked number inside a boxed
     number of that kind. Neither looks at the number: it is not
     restricted to a range. Neither has a value on poison: a poison
     constant is not boxed, and a boxed poison, which is a boxed number
     (FlambdaValueSpec.v), is not unboxed, as [is_number_of_kind] goes
     by the constructor of the constant.
   - [Unary_int_arith] is on an integer of the kind it carries, and
     gives one.
   - [Num_conv] changes an integer of the kind [src] into the integer
     of the kind [dst] that is the same modulo two to the width of
     [dst]: the same integer where [dst] holds it, as it does where it
     is at least as wide as [src], and the integer wrapped where it
     does not. This is what Simplify folds it to
     ([Simplify_unary_primitive.Make_simplify_int_conv], with the
     [to_immediate], [to_naked_int8], ... of [Number_adjuncts], each of
     which keeps the low bits of the number and extends their sign),
     and what the backend computes
     ([Cmm_helpers.Scalar_type.Integral.static_cast]: nothing where
     the destination holds every number of the source, a sign
     extension of the low bits where it does not). Between the tagged
     and the naked immediates it is [Untag_immediate] and
     [Tag_immediate].
   - [Boolean_not] is the negation of a boolean of the source, which is
     the tagged immediate 0 or 1: 1 for 0 and 0 for 1. It has no value
     on another tagged immediate, nor on anything else.
   - [Untag_immediate] and [Tag_immediate] change a tagged immediate into
     the naked immediate that is the same integer, and back. *)
(* CR mshinwell: [Get_tag] has no value on what is not a block: a tagged
   immediate, null, a closure, a boxed number, a string. On anything
   allocated the machine reads the tag in the header. Simplify makes it
   [Invalid] on null and on a boxed number, and leaves it alone on a
   tagged immediate; the unboxing of variants records the tag of a
   scrutinee that may be an immediate. It would be wrong if the
   compiler makes a [Get_tag] that is executed on a closure, a boxed
   number or a string and uses the result. Decisions D5 and D22. *)
(* CR mshinwell: [Box_number] has no value on a poison constant, and
   [Unbox_number] none on a boxed number whose contents are poison,
   although such a box is a boxed number for [Is_null] and [Is_int]
   (FlambdaValueSpec.v). Nothing in the compiler says what boxing a
   poison means when it is executed; the backend makes a poison some
   number of its kind, which it would box and unbox like another. It
   would be wrong if a poison may be boxed where the code is executed
   and the box is then only passed on, not read. Decision D21. *)
(* CR mshinwell: [Boolean_not] has no value on a tagged immediate other
   than 0 and 1. Simplify makes it [Invalid] where its argument cannot
   be 0 or 1 ([Simplify_unary_primitive.simplify_boolean_not]), so the
   model cannot give it a value there. The machine flips one bit of
   the word ([Cmm_helpers.mk_not]), which gives the integer with its
   lowest bit flipped. The front end makes the primitive from [not] of
   the source, whose argument has the type [bool]; nothing checks that
   it is given a boolean. It would be wrong if code that is executed
   applies it to another integer and uses the result: then Simplify
   removes code that runs, and the model, by making it undefined, does
   not say so. Decision D38. *)

(* [String_or_bigstring_load] of an integer from an immutable string.
   The index is a naked nativeint, and is that of a byte, the first
   being at index 0, whatever the width. The load reads as many bytes as
   the width has, from the one at the index on, the least significant
   first: the model is of a little-endian target, as the two 64-bit
   targets of the compiler are ([Arch.big_endian] is [false] for both).
   With [Eight] and [Sixteen] the result is a naked immediate, of what
   was read without a sign, from 0 to 255 and to 65535. With the others
   it is the integer of the width that has the bits read: a naked int8
   for [Eight_signed], a naked int16 for [Sixteen_signed], a naked int32
   for [Thirty_two] and a naked int64 for [Sixty_four]. This is
   [To_cmm_primitive.string_like_load], with the loads of
   [Cmm_helpers.unaligned_load_16] and the like, and the kinds are those
   of [Flambda_primitive.result_kind_of_binary_primitive'].
   It has no value on what is not a string, or unless the string has
   every byte that is read: the machine would read whatever is there,
   and the front end makes such a load after a test of the index
   ([Lambda_to_flambda_primitives.string_like_load]), or without one
   for [String.unsafe_get] and the like. Simplify does not compute it
   ([Simplify_binary_primitive.simplify_string_or_bigstring_load]). *)
(* CR mshinwell: the byte after the last of a string is one of the
   string's block in the compiler, and is 0, so that a load of two bytes
   from the last index has a value on the machine. It has none here:
   the front end's test refuses it, and an unsafe load that reads it is
   taken to be a mistake of the program. Should it be 0? *)
(* CR mshinwell: a string of the model is an immutable value, so this
   load gives the byte the string was made with, whenever it is done.
   The compiler erases the conversions between bytes and strings before
   Flambda 2 ([Lambda_to_lambda_transforms]: [Pbytes_to_string] and
   [Pbytes_of_string] applied to an argument become the argument), so
   that a string of the compiler's can be the block of bytes that are
   written later; and [To_cmm] moves a load from a string, which has no
   effect and no coeffect ([Flambda_primitive]), past such a write
   (X5-3). A string made from bytes by an erased conversion is outside
   the model, which has no bytes: the conversion to the model refuses
   every primitive on bytes, but cannot see an erased conversion. *)

(* [Phys_equal]: whether two values of kind [Value] are the same value.
   The compiler compares the two machine words
   ([To_cmm_primitive.phys_equal]), which for two tagged immediates is
   whether they are the same integer. It is what [=] and [<>] at type
   [int] of the source become ([Lambda_to_flambda_primitives], at
   [Pphys_equal]), as well as [==] and [!=]. Simplify folds it by
   [Provers.prove_physical_equality], which on two constants answers
   whether they are the same constant.

   It has a value on two tagged immediates: whether they are the same
   integer. And on a tagged immediate against an allocated value (a
   block, a closure, a boxed number, a string, or a symbol bound to
   one): they are not the same, as the word of the one is odd and that
   of the other a pointer, and as [prove_physical_equality] answers. It
   has no value on anything else. *)
(* CR mshinwell: [Phys_equal] has no value on two allocated values, on
   null or on poison, where the machine compares any two words. This is
   a first version, and not what the primitive is to mean in the end.
   - On two allocated values, what it means is part of the design of
     the heap, which is to extend this definition. The allocated values
     of the model have no identity, and the compiler shares equal
     immutable values (it makes one of two equal [Make_block]s or
     [Box_number]s, and lifts constants), which turns an answer of 0
     into 1. Simplify answers 1 on the same variable or symbol twice,
     and 0 on two different symbols and on allocated values of
     different sorts.
   - On null, the machine has the word 0, equal to itself and to no
     tagged immediate or pointer, and Simplify folds two nulls to 1 and
     a null against another constant or a symbol to 0. No value here
     as for [Is_int] on null, until the model says what null is.
   - On poison, Simplify folds two poisons of the same kind and name to
     1 and a poison against any other constant or a symbol to 0
     ([Reg_width_const.equal]), and the backend makes a poison of kind
     [Value] a tagged immediate, which may be the other argument. No
     value is sound for both, and is right only if a poison is never
     the argument of a [Phys_equal] that is executed.
   No value is conservative: it would be wrong only in that nothing is
   then proved of a program that compares such values, as library code
   does with [==]. Decision D19. *)

   agree, the subkinds come from the types of the source, and the

(* What a primitive computes on its arguments it computes on values
   that the observations read alike. The premise is a relation between
   values, the first read under [statics] and the second under
   [statics'], in three parts:
   - related values are the same constant, or neither is a constant
     ([relates_constants]);
   - a constant and a boxed number are related to themselves, and blocks
     made alike of related fields are related ([relates_made]): what a
     primitive makes of related arguments is related;
   - what an observation answers of the first value it answers of the
     second, with related parts, and if the first is not a symbol bound
     to nothing nor is the second ([relates_observations]).
   Equality is such a relation when the two static environments are the
   same. So is the relation between a value and the same value with a
   symbol in place of some of the blocks, boxed numbers and closures in
   it, each symbol bound to what it stands for
   (FlambdaLiftSpec.value_lifted): that is what lets a [Let] of a block
   be made a static binding of a symbol.

   The law goes one way: where the primitive has a value on the first
   arguments it has a related one on the second. Nothing is said where
   it has none on the first; the second may then have a value. So it is
   not that related values cannot be told apart, only that an answer
   given of the first is given of the second.

   It holds because every primitive reads an allocated argument through
   the observations only: by its tag, its fields, its contents, and
   never by which allocation it is. It constrains what a primitive may
   ever do: none may have a value that depends on the identity of an
   immutable allocated value. In particular [Phys_equal] can have no
   value on two of them, or it would tell a block from a symbol bound to
   an equal block. With a heap the premise needs one more part, that a
   location is related to a location only. *)
