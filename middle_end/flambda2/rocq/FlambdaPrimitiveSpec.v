(* What the primitives of FlambdaPrimitiveModel.v compute, their kinds,
   and the laws that every primitive obeys.

   This file is to be reviewed: [eval_prim] and what it is made of, against
   middle_end/flambda2/terms/flambda_primitive.mli for what each primitive
   is, and against middle_end/flambda2/simplify/simplify_unary_primitive.ml,
   simplify_binary_primitive.ml, simplify_variadic_primitive.ml and
   number_adjuncts.ml for what Simplify takes each to compute; the kinds,
   against [arg_kind_of_unary_primitive], [args_kind_of_binary_primitive],
   [args_kind_of_variadic_primitive] and the [result_kind_of_] functions
   of flambda_primitive.ml; and the statements at the end.

   [eval_prim statics p vs] is the value of the primitive [p] applied to
   the values [vs], if it has one. Where it has none the term is
   undefined (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v), and a transformation may do
   anything to it. A primitive has no value
   - when it is not given as many arguments as it takes;
   - when an argument is not of the kind it takes: this is what Simplify
     assumes, which replaces a primitive applied to an argument of the
     wrong kind by [Invalid] ([Simplify_primitive.arg_kind_mismatch]);
   - when an argument is not what the primitive is for, even if of the
     right kind: the cases are listed at each primitive below. Most are
     there because Simplify assumes that the case does not arise, where
     the machine would compute something;
   - when it computes with an integer that is out of the range of its
     kind;
   - when an argument is a symbol that is bound to nothing
     ([eval_prim_symbols_bound_statement]): any operation on such a
     symbol is undefined, and a well-formed term has none.

   The integers. The model is of a 64-bit target: the tagged and the
   naked immediates are OCaml's [int], of 63 bits, and the other kinds
   have 8, 16, 32 and 64 bits ([int_width]). A constant holds any integer
   (FlambdaModel.v); the arithmetic, the comparisons, tagging and
   untagging take only integers in the range of their kind
   ([int_of_value]), and their results are in range. Arithmetic is on
   mathematical integers and wraps ([wrap]), which is two's complement.

   Numbers in range. The compiler's numbers are of types that hold a
   range only, and the model's are integers. The section "Numbers in
   range" says which integers the compiler's are: a constant of each
   kind ([const_in_range]), the tag of a block ([tag_in_range]), the
   numbers that a primitive carries ([prim_in_range]), and a value all
   of whose numbers are such ([value_in_range]). A unit that passes the
   check FlambdaWellFormedSpec.numbers_in_range has no other, and no
   primitive makes one ([eval_prim_in_range_statement]), so the run of
   such a unit never meets one (FlambdaRangeSpec.v).
   FlambdaPrimitiveProofs.v shows that the results of arithmetic are in
   range, that at 64 bits [wrap], [unsigned] and [in_range] are the
   [wrap64], [unsigned64] and [fits_int64] of rocq/OxCamlInt64.v, and
   that at 63 bits addition, subtraction and multiplication are those of
   OCaml's [int] as rocq/OxCamlInt.v models it.

   Allocated values are read through the observations of
   FlambdaValueSpec.v ([block_of], ...), which look through a symbol to
   what it is bound to. So the value of a primitive may depend on the
   static environment, but only on what the symbols among its arguments
   are bound to ([eval_prim_static_values_statement]).

   Arrays. No value here is an array: the only arrays of the model are
   those that have an identity, which are cells of the heap of C4's
   prototype (FlambdaHeapSpec.v). So [eval_prim] has no value on
   [Array_length] and on [Array_load], as it has none on the primitives
   of the heap. The section "Arrays" says what the four primitives of
   arrays compute on the elements of an array, which is what
   FlambdaHeapSpec.v applies to a cell; it is to be reviewed against
   [Simplify_common.specialise_array_kind] and the functions for
   arrays of the four files of Simplify above, and against
   [Lambda_to_flambda_primitives] for the checks of bounds that the
   front end puts before an access.

   The laws. The rest of the model does not look inside a primitive: it
   uses the statements at the end, which hold of every primitive.
   [eval_prim] is opaque after FlambdaPrimitiveProofs.v, as [step] is, so
   that no proof elsewhere comes to depend on which primitives there are.
   A proof about one primitive rewrites with the equation of its arity
   there ([eval_prim_unary], [eval_prim_binary], [eval_prim_variadic]).
   The last law says that the value of a primitive on its arguments is
   its value on arguments that the observations read alike
   ([eval_prim_related_statement]): a block made by a primitive and a
   symbol bound to an equal block, for one.

   The proofs are in FlambdaPrimitiveProofs.v, which needs no review. *)

   [Swap_byte_endianness] puts the bytes of an integer in the opposite
   order, and is not the same thing at every kind:
   - at the two kinds of immediates it is the swap of the two low bytes
     and nothing of the others: the result is from 0 to 65535, whatever
     the bits of the argument above the sixteenth. It is what [%bswap16]

   - at the naked int16, int32, int64 and nativeint it is the integer
     of the kind whose bytes are those of the argument in the opposite
     order, so that the last byte of the argument gives the sign.

   Simplify computes of a constant: [swap_byte_endianness] of each

   changes nothing but an [Lsr] by 0, which is the integer shifted and
   not its unsigned reading (FlambdaPrimitiveProofs.v,
   [eval_int_shift_asr] and [eval_int_shift_lsr]). *)
(* CR mshinwell: [Int_shift] has no value on an amount that is negative,

   shifts by the amount modulo the size of the register on x86-64, so
   the two differ: on a shift by 64, which the machine does not do at
   all, and on an arithmetic shift right of a negative number.
   For the naked immediates the bound is 63, where it is 64 for the
   tagged ones, which are the same integers: Simplify folds a shift
   right by 63 of a negative naked immediate to 0 and the machine gives
   -1 (C1-9). The library documents that amount as unspecified for the
   untagged [int] and as specified for [int]. No value is what the

   block to have that tag and that field only where it does not already
   know the field, when it reads it whatever the tag; it does not use
   the size.

   The mutability of the load is not looked at. It says what the
   compiler may take of the load: one marked [Immutable] or

   not ([Simplify_unary_primitive.simplify_mutable_block_load] keeps

   test of the block: the machine reads the field
   ([To_cmm_primitive.block_load]), and a block of the model is
   immutable, so that a load marked [Mutable] from one, which is what
   [%field0] of the source makes when it is applied to a tuple, reads
   what the block was made with. ([fst] and [snd] of the standard

   marked [Immutable].) When the model has blocks that can be written,
   the effects of a load will go by its mark and not by the block, as

   a load marked [Mutable] has a coeffect); today no primitive of the

     restricted to a range. Neither has a value on poison: a poison
     constant is not boxed, and a boxed poison, which is a boxed number
     (FlambdaValueSpec.v), is not unboxed, as [is_number_of_kind] goes
     by the constructor of the constant.

   first: the model is of a little-endian target, as the two 64-bit
   targets of the compiler are ([Arch.big_endian] is [false] for both).
   With [Eight] and [Sixteen] the result is a naked immediate, of what
   was read without a sign, from 0 to 255 and to 65535. With the others
   it is the integer of the width that has the bits read: a naked int8
   for [Eight_signed], a naked int16 for [Sixteen_signed], a naked int32
   for [Thirty_two] and a naked int64 for [Sixty_four]. This is

   [Cmm_helpers.unaligned_load_16] and the like, and the kinds are those
   of [Flambda_primitive.result_kind_of_binary_primitive'].
   It has no value on what is not a string, or unless the string has
   every byte that is read: the machine would read whatever is there,
   and the front end makes such a load after a test of the index
   ([Lambda_to_flambda_primitives.string_like_load]), or without one
   for [String.unsafe_get] and the like. Simplify does not compute it
   ([Simplify_binary_primitive.simplify_string_or_bigstring_load]). *)
(* CR mshinwell: the byte after the last of a string is one of the

(* [Phys_equal]: whether two values of kind [Value] are the same value.
   The compiler compares the two machine words
   ([To_cmm_primitive.phys_equal]), which for two tagged immediates is
   whether they are the same integer. It is what [=] and [<>] at type
   [int] of the source become ([Lambda_to_flambda_primitives], at
   [Pphys_equal]), as well as [==] and [!=]. Simplify folds it by
   [Provers.prove_physical_equality], which on two constants answers
   whether they are the same constant.

   It has a value on two tagged immediates: whether they are the same
   integer. And on a tagged immediate against an allocated value (a
   block, a closure, a boxed number, a string, or a symbol bound to
   one): they are not the same, as the word of the one is odd and that
   of the other a pointer, and as [prove_physical_equality] answers.

   An imported symbol ([FlambdaValueSpec.imported_of]) of either class
   is not a tagged immediate either: it is a pointer.

   It has a value where one of the two is an identity: an imported
   symbol of the class [Import_identity]
   ([FlambdaValueSpec.identity_of]). Two identities are the same when
   they are one symbol: [prove_physical_equality] answers so of any two
   symbols. An identity is not an allocated value (a block, a closure,
   a boxed number, a string, or a symbol bound to one), and is not an
   imported symbol of the class [Import_data]. This is what a handler
   does to tell which exception it has caught: it compares the
   exception, or its first field, with the symbol of a predefined
   exception (lambda/matching.ml, [combine_extension_constructor]), and
   what it caught may be a block: an exception with arguments.

   It has no value on anything else. So an imported symbol of the class
   [Import_data] is as an immutable allocated value is: the comparison
   has no value on it against an allocated value, against another
   imported symbol of that class, or against itself. And an identity
   against null, poison, a number that is not a value or a symbol that
   is not bound has no value, as a tagged immediate against them has
   none. *)
(* CR mshinwell: [Phys_equal] has no value on two allocated values, on
   null or on poison, where the machine compares any two words. This is
   a first version, and not what the primitive is to mean in the end.
   - On two allocated values, what it means is part of the design of
     the heap, which is to extend this definition. The allocated values
     of the model have no identity, and the compiler shares equal
     immutable values (it makes one of two equal [Make_block]s or
     [Box_number]s, and lifts constants), which turns an answer of 0
     into 1. Simplify answers 1 on the same variable or symbol twice,
     and 0 on two different symbols and on allocated values of
     different sorts.
   - On null, the machine has the word 0, equal to itself and to no
     tagged immediate or pointer, and Simplify folds two nulls to 1 and
     a null against another constant or a symbol to 0. No value here
     as for [Is_int] on null, until the model says what null is.
   - On poison, Simplify folds two poisons of the same kind and name to
     1 and a poison against any other constant or a symbol to 0
     ([Reg_width_const.equal]), and the backend makes a poison of kind
     [Value] a tagged immediate, which may be the other argument. No
     value is sound for both, and is right only if a poison is never
     the argument of a [Phys_equal] that is executed.
   No value is conservative: it would be wrong only in that nothing is
   then proved of a program that compares such values, as library code
   does with [==]. Decision D19. *)
(* CR mshinwell: [Phys_equal] answers 0 of an identity against an
   allocated value of the unit and against an import that is data, and
   of two identities with different symbols. The machine code does;
   Simplify proves it only of two symbols, or where the shapes of the
   two types differ. The reason it is right: an identity is made once
   (by the runtime for a predefined exception, by the unit that
   declares an exception otherwise) and is never copied or shared, so
   nothing that a unit allocates, and nothing that Simplify shares or
   lifts, can be it. That the compiler shares equal immutable values
   (decision D30) is about immutable structure, which an identity is
   not. It rests on two things that are not checked here. One is that
   the class is given to nothing but an exception: the conversion from
   the compiler's terms decides it, from the symbol alone, and is to
   give it to the predefined exceptions only until something can check
   more. The other is that two symbols of that class are two objects:
   [exception E = Not_found] in another unit makes no second symbol,
   only another name for the first. For an import that is data there
   is no such reason, since Simplify may know its contents from the
   other unit and share it with a block of this one, and the comparison
   has no value. Decision 2 of requests/C5-imported-symbols.md. *)

   An array keeps the kind it was made at, and each of its elements is
   a value that this kind holds ([array_element_ok]): a tagged
   immediate for [Array_immediates], anything of kind [Value] for the
   two others. The kind is kept because Simplify keeps it: the type
   that it gives a mutable array has the kind of the elements, and

   or a store at a kind of naked numbers of an array whose type has
   another kind of element.

(* What a primitive computes on its arguments it computes on values
   that the observations read alike. The premise is a relation between
   values, the first read under [statics] and the second under
   [statics'], in three parts:
   - related values are the same constant, or neither is a constant
     ([relates_constants]);
   - a constant and a boxed number are related to themselves, and blocks
     made alike of related fields are related ([relates_made]): what a
     primitive makes of related arguments is related;
   - what an observation answers of the first value it answers of the
     second, with related parts; if the first is a closure or a partial
     application so is the second; if the first is not a symbol bound
     to nothing nor is the second; and if the first is an imported
     symbol the second is the same imported symbol, of the same class
     ([relates_observations]).
   Equality is such a relation when the two static environments are the
   same. So is the relation between a value and the same value with a
   symbol in place of some of the blocks, boxed numbers and closures in
   it, each symbol bound to what it stands for
   (FlambdaLiftSpec.value_lifted): that is what lets a [Let] of a block
   be made a static binding of a symbol.

   The law goes one way: where the primitive has a value on the first
   arguments it has a related one on the second. Nothing is said where
   it has none on the first; the second may then have a value. So it is
   not that related values cannot be told apart, only that an answer
   given of the first is given of the second.

   It holds because every primitive reads an allocated argument through
   the observations only: by its tag, its fields, its contents, and
   never by which allocation it is. It constrains what a primitive may
   ever do: none may have a value that depends on the identity of an
   immutable allocated value. In particular [Phys_equal] can have no
   value on two of them, or it would tell a block from a symbol bound to
   an equal block. What it answers of an imported symbol does depend on
   its class, and of an identity on which symbol it is, and the last
   part of the premise is for that.
   With a heap the premise needs one more part, that a location is
   related to a location only. *)
