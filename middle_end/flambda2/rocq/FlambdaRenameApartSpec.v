(* Giving every binder of a term a name of its own: a normalisation that
   is an equivalence.

   This file is to be reviewed: [rename_apart], which is extracted and run
   by the validation of middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/; the names
   of a term ([variables_of], [continuations_of]), which two statements
   mention; and the statements. What makes the candidate
   ([renamed_apart] and what it is made of) need not be read for the
   first statement: [rename_apart] keeps the candidate only if the
   comparison up to bound names (FlambdaCompareSpec.expr_eqb) says it is
   the term, and gives the term back as it was otherwise. So that
   statement holds whatever the candidate is, by the soundness of the
   comparison alone.

   Why it is needed. Simplify gives fresh names to the binders of a
   function body each time it inlines it. The inlining of the validation
   (FlambdaNormaliseSpec.inline_calls) copies the body as it is, so a
   function inlined twice leaves two [Let]s of the same variable, one in
   the scope of the other:

     let v = x * x in let r = v in let v = y * y in ... v + r ...

   FlambdaAliasesSpec.follow_aliases forgets that [r] is [v] where [v] is
   bound again, as it must, the alias stays, and the term is not the one
   Simplify made. With every binder renamed apart nothing is bound twice
   and the alias is followed.

   The candidate. Every binder of the term is given a new name, and its
   uses are renamed: the variable of a [Let], the parameters of a
   handler, the continuation of a [Let_cont], and the binders of code
   (its parameters, its closure, its two continuations). Symbols, code
   ids and slots are left alone. There are as many new names as the
   term has binders ([binders]), and they are made by
   FlambdaFreshQuantifierSpec.fresh_names, different from one another
   and from every name of the term ([names_of]); the term is gone
   through once, each binder taking the next of them ([apart]). The uses
   are renamed by the renamings of FlambdaNominalSpec.v, which are
   permutations: at a binder, what the name is under the renaming so far
   is swapped with the new name ([bind_variable], [bind_continuation]).
   This file makes no name by itself and does not look at the numbers of
   names.

   Renaming. [rename_apart] does not commute with a renaming of the
   term: the new names are made from the names of the term, and those of
   the renamed term are others. It commutes up to the new names: for a
   renaming [r] there is a renaming that does to every name of the term
   what [r] does, and with which the result for the renamed term is the
   renamed result ([rename_apart_equivariant_up_to_names_statement]). In
   particular it agrees with [r] on the free variables and
   continuations of the term, those of its code included
   ([rename_apart_equivariant_up_to_statement]). Nothing is asked of the
   term.

   The proofs are in FlambdaRenameApartProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
