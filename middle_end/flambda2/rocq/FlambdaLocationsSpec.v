(* The locations of the heap as a sort of names: the action of their
   permutations on what the machine holds.

   This file is to be reviewed: the action ([permute_value] and the
   functions after it), the locations of each thing, and the
   statements.

   A location is the name of a cell of the heap (FlambdaValueSpec.v).
   It is compared by equality only, and nothing is meant to depend on
   which number it is: a run that allocates chooses a location that
   the heap does not bind, and from a state all of whose locations
   its heap binds another choice should give the same run with other
   names. That is the property this file prepares for; it is not
   stated here ("What is not here" says where it is). So the locations
   are treated as a sort of names, the third beside the variables and
   the continuations, and what is said of names in
   FlambdaNameAbstractionSpec.v is said of them here.

   Where locations are. A value may be a location or hold one in a
   field, a value slot or an argument kept. So locations are in the
   environments of variables, in the continuations (the environment of
   a closure, the values kept with a continuation), in the statically
   allocated values, and in the heap, whose keys are locations and
   whose cells hold values. There is none in a term, in code, in a
   constant, in a kind or in a primitive, and there is no binder of
   locations in a term: the only thing that makes one is an
   allocation, in the machine.

   The action. A permutation of locations
   (FlambdaNominalSpec.permutation, a list of swaps) acts on values
   ([permute_value]: a location is moved, and the values inside a
   value are gone into), on cells and heaps ([permute_cell],
   [permute_heap]: the keys of the heap are moved with the values of
   its cells; the mutability of a block, its tag and the kind of an
   array are as they were), on environments, continuations and static
   environments ([permute_env], [permute_cont_value],
   [permute_static_env]: handlers and code are left as they are), and
   on states, on what a step comes to and on behaviours
   ([permute_state], [permute_result], [permute_behaviour]: the
   expression and the continuation of an exit are left as they are).

   The locations of a thing ([locations_of_cell] and the functions
   after it; those of a value are FlambdaHeapSpec.locations_of_value)
   are all the locations that occur in it, the keys of a heap among
   them. They are lists and a location may be there more than once.

   What is stated.
   - Each of the seven kinds of thing, with its action, its locations
     and the equality [=], obeys the laws of
     FlambdaNameAbstractionSpec.nominal: the identity does nothing,
     the action of a composition is the composition of the actions,
     two lists of swaps that are the same permutation act alike, the
     locations of a thing moved are its locations moved, and a
     permutation that fixes the locations of a thing leaves it as it
     is. So each is a nominal set whose support is its locations.
   - The action on states has inverses
     ([permute_state_inverse_statement]).
   - This action and that of the renamings of variables and
     continuations (FlambdaEquivarianceSpec.rename_state) commute
     ([rename_permute_state_statement]): the first moves nothing in a
     term and the second nothing in a value.
   - Looking a location up in a heap, and a variable up in an
     environment, go through the action
     ([lookup_permute_heap_statement],
     [lookup_permute_env_statement]); the kind of a value is that of
     the value moved ([kind_of_permute_value_statement]); and a heap
     moved binds a location moved exactly where the heap binds the
     location ([is_bound_permute_heap_statement]).

   What is not here. That the machine goes through the action: that
   is in two other files. A step that allocates chooses a location
   outside the domain of the heap, computed from the locations that
   the heap binds (FlambdaHeapSpec.fresh_location), and that choice
   does not commute with a permutation, as no choice of a name does
   (NAMES.md, section 7). So the statements there are about a heap
   that binds every location at hand, those of an entry of the heap
   that a later write hides among them (a location that is held and
   is not bound may be the one that an allocation chooses, and then
   the allocation captures it), and they are up to a second
   permutation that agrees with the first on the locations that the
   heap binds: FlambdaLocationsPrimitiveSpec.v for the primitives,
   the two that allocate among them, and
   FlambdaLocationsMachineSpec.v for a step, a run and a behaviour
   of the machine. A step of the machine does not run the primitives
   of the heap yet, so no step allocates; the statements about a
   step are in the form that stays true when one does. The link with
   the relation between outcomes of FlambdaHeapMachineSpec.v, which pairs
   locations by a correspondence, is not stated.

   Nothing is trusted here. The proofs are in
   FlambdaLocationsProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
