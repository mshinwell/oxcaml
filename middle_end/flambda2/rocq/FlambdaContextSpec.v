(* Rewriting inside a term: refinement and equivalence of expressions are
   preserved by every context.

   This file is to be reviewed: [context] and [plug], against the terms of
   FlambdaModel.v (a context is a term with one hole, which may be under
   any binder and in the handler of a continuation), and the two
   statements. They are what lets a rewrite proved of two expressions on
   their own, such as those of FlambdaControlFlowSpec.v, be applied to a
   subterm of a program.

   The premise is a refinement under all environments ([expr_refines]). A
   rewrite that is sound only under what is known of the variables in
   scope, as most of the simplifier's are, is not covered: that needs a
   refinement relative to a property of the environments.

   The proofs are in FlambdaContextProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
