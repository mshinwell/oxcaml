   into a record with a mutable field, a [ref], an object, a copy made

   two empty arrays of a program may be physically equal, and a
   location for each would tell them apart. No term that the front end
   makes has a [Make_array] of no argument. It would be wrong if a
   pass comes to make one and the term is executed. Decided while the

   [Is_null] answer no; [Opaque_identity] is the location. The remaining
   unary primitives are on numbers or on strings, and have no value: a
   cell is neither. A primitive that is added and that reads a cell has
   its case here.
   Of an array, [Array_length] is the number of elements
   (FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.array_length_of), whatever the kind it
   carries; [Is_null] answers no, and so does [Is_int] without
   [variant_only]; [Opaque_identity] is the location. With
   [variant_only], [Is_int] has no value on an array, which is no
   variant: Simplify makes it [Invalid] there
   ([Provers.prove_is_int_generic_value]), as on a closure, a boxed
   number or a string (FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.eval_is_int). [Get_tag] and
   [Block_load] have no value on an array, nor [Array_length] on a
   block. *)
(* CR mshinwell: a [Block_load] marked [Immutable] has no value on a
   block made [Mutable]. Simplify takes a field so read never to change
   afterwards (it records the field in the type of the block and shares
   later loads), and nothing checks that (C4-2, R2-20). This first
   stage excludes more than that assumption does: every record with
   both mutable and immutable fields, from the first read of an
   immutable field.
   Two things that the front end makes are outside the model by ruling,
   at every stage, and the conversion refuses them:
   - the blocks that tail-modulo-cons builds (lambda/tmc.ml:
     placeholders made [Mutable], filled with [Heap_initialization],
     then read with immutable loads; R2-18): "we can ignore TMC for now
     b/c ... the pass produces broken Lambda code, that needs fixing in
     the prod compiler";
   - [Duplicate_block] followed by stores, which is the copy of a large
     record for [{ r with ... }] (lambda/translcore.ml,
     [transl_record]; miscompiled today, C4-4): "I think we can not
     model Pduprecord for the moment, it is broken as you say and is
     being fixed in prod".
