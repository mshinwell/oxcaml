(* Inlining a call with the variables of the code exchanged for fresh
   ones.

   This file is to be reviewed: [code_variables], [open_code],
   [inlined_at], [inlined_fresh] and the statements; and against the
   simplifier's [Inlining_transforms.inline]
   (simplify/inlining/inlining_transforms.ml), which opens the code by
   [Function_params_and_body.pattern_match], and so at fresh names,
   before it binds the closure and the arguments.

   FlambdaApplySpec.v says that a direct call refines the body of its
   code inlined ([inline_let_code_statement]), with [my_closure] and
   the parameters of the code as the variables of the [Let]s that bind
   the closure and the arguments. Two of its premises
   (FlambdaApplySpec.inlinable) say that those bindings capture nothing:
   [my_closure] and the parameters are not free in the arguments. The
   simplifier has no such condition, because it takes fresh names.
   Here is that:

   - [open_code fresh c] is [c] with [my_closure] and its parameters
     exchanged for the variables [fresh], in its body too. It is
     [rename_code] at the swaps, and the binders of closed code may be
     renamed (FlambdaNominalSpec.rename_code_binders_statement).
   - A call refines the body of the code opened at [fresh], inlined
     ([inline_at_statement]), for every list [fresh] of as many
     different variables that are not variables of the code and not
     free in the arguments. This is the explicit form: it says which
     names will do. The two premises about capture are gone; in their
     place the code is asked to be closed in the sense of
     FlambdaBindersSpec.v and its variables to be distinct, as they
     are in a well-formed term.
   - [inlined_fresh avoid c r ap] is the function: it takes the names to
     avoid, makes the fresh variables by
     FlambdaFreshQuantifierSpec.fresh_names, and inlines at them. A
     call refines it when the names to avoid include the free
     variables of the arguments ([inline_fresh_statement]).
   - The choice does not matter ([inline_at_choice_statement],
     [inline_fresh_choice_statement]): two lists of fresh variables,
     or two lists of names to avoid, give alpha-equivalent terms. The
     variables made are bound in the result, by the [Let]s; so the two
     results are related by alpha-equivalence, which the permutation
     that exchanges the two lists gives
     (FlambdaAlphaSpec.Alpha_rename), and not by equality of the
     second with the first renamed: a fresh variable is outside the
     free variables of the body and may be one that the body binds.
     For this the fresh variables are also outside the callee.
   - With the quantifier ([inline_at_fresh_statement]): for all but
     finitely many lists of variables the call refines the code
     inlined at them. It follows from the explicit form, and says
     less.

   The refinement is given in the two forms of FlambdaApplySpec.v: of
   a call with the binding of its code in sight, as
   [inline_let_code_statement] is ([inline_at_statement],
   [inline_fresh_statement]); and of a state in whose static
   environment the code id of the call is bound to the code, as
   [inline_statement] is ([inline_at_state_statement],
   [inline_fresh_state_statement]). The second is the form for a pass
   that inlines the calls of the code it has seen bound.

   Nothing is trusted here. The proofs are in
   FlambdaInlineFreshProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
