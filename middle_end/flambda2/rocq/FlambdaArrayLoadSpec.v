(* The length and an element of an immutable array that is known: a
   normalisation that refines.

   This file is to be reviewed: [load_known_arrays] and what it is made
   of, which are extracted and run by the validation of
   middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/; [rename_known_arrays]; and the
   statements.

   What Simplify does. It gives a [Make_array] that is marked
   [Immutable] the type of an immutable array of the types of its
   arguments
   ([Simplify_variadic_primitive.simplify_make_array]), and a symbol
   that is bound to an immutable array of values the type of its
   static constant. With such a type the length of the array is the
   number of its elements, a constant
   ([Simplify_unary_primitive.simplify_array_length], a projection of
   the type), and a load at an index that is one known tagged immediate
   has the type of that element, which is reified: the element itself
   where it is a constant, a symbol or a variable
   ([Simplify_binary_primitive.simplify_array_load], which does not
   look at the mutability that the load carries, and gives [Invalid]
   where the index is out of the bounds). So in the term after
   Simplify the length of an array that the same code has made is a
   constant, the test of an index against it is decided or is a test
   against a constant, a load at a constant index is the element, and
   an array that is then unused is gone.

   What is here. There are no types of arrays in the model, so
   [load_known_arrays] does it for the two cases in which an array is
   known from the term alone, as FlambdaBlockLoadSpec.load_known_blocks
   does for the fields of a block. It goes through a term keeping
   ([known_arrays]):

   - for a variable bound by a [Let] to a [Make_immutable_array], the
     arguments of the primitive ([array_made_by]). The primitive of the
     model is the one of an immutable array of values
     (FlambdaPrimitiveModel.v): an array that is mutable is made by a
     primitive of the heap, so nothing is ever known of one;
   - for a symbol bound by a [Let_static] to a
     [Static_const_immutable_value_array], its elements
     ([static_array_made]). That too is immutable.

   The two are read alike, through FlambdaValueSpec.array_of, by the
   primitives and by the proof.

   A [Let] of a primitive applied to such a variable or symbol becomes
   a [Let] of a [Simple] ([load_known_array_named], [of_known_array]):

   - [Array_length], at any array kind, becomes the number of the
     elements, a tagged immediate, if that number is one
     ([length_of_known]);
   - [Array_load], at any kinds and any mark of mutability, at an index
     that is a constant tagged immediate, at least 0 and below the
     number of the elements, becomes what the element holds, if that is
     still known ([element_loaded]).

   Anything else is left as it is: a load at an index that is a
   variable; and a load at a constant index out of the bounds, which
   has no value (FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.array_index) and which Simplify
   makes [Invalid]. So the pass does not fire there, although anything
   would refine the term.

   Nothing else is rewritten. The [Let] stays, as with
   FlambdaBlockLoadSpec.load_known_blocks: the variable is then a
   constant or an alias of the element, which other passes follow, and
   the [Make_immutable_array] is removed if it is then unused.

   Going under a binder, what is known of its name is forgotten, and so
   is what any element that is that name holds ([forget_array_var],
   with FlambdaBlockLoadSpec.forget_field): the name stands for
   something else from there on. The number of the elements of such an
   array stays known, and so does what its other elements hold. A
   handler of a non-recursive continuation is gone into, with what is
   known where it is defined; the handlers of recursive ones and the
   bodies of code are left as they are
   (FlambdaRecHandlersSpec.rewrite_rec_handlers and
   FlambdaNormaliseSpec.rewrite_code take a round of the validation
   into them, with nothing known there).

   The result refines the term ([load_known_arrays_refines_statement]).
   It is not claimed to be equivalent to it: a load has no value where
   the element is not one that its load kind holds
   (FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.array_loaded), and the element has one. So
   the pass is for the term before Simplify. The fold of the length
   keeps the range check of the primitive: where the number of the
   elements is not a tagged immediate, the primitive is left as it
   is.

   It commutes with renaming, when what it knows is renamed with the
   term ([load_arrays_knowing_equivariant_statement],
   [load_known_arrays_equivariant_statement]). That it keeps scope is
   in FlambdaArrayLoadScopeSpec.v.

   What is not here: the length of an array that the code does not
   make, known by Simplify from the type of a parameter, of a value
   slot or of what two arms give one continuation; the tests of an
   index under an arm of a [Switch] on the length; a second load of
   the same element, which is not shared with the first
   (FlambdaCseSpec.shareable).

   The proofs are in FlambdaArrayLoadProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
