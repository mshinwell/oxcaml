(* The freshness quantifier: "for all but finitely many names".

   This file is to be reviewed: [for_fresh] and its notation, [supports],
   [propositions], and the statements. The compiler has nothing to check
   it against: it makes a fresh name from a counter and states nothing of
   it. The definition and the laws are those of the literature on nominal
   sets, where the quantifier is written with a reversed N: Gabbay and
   Pitts, "A new approach to abstract syntax with variable binding"
   (2002), and Pitts, "Nominal Sets: Names and Symmetry in Computer
   Science" (2013), section 3.2.

   [И a, P a] says that [P a] holds of all but finitely many names [a].
   It is the way to say "for a fresh [a]" without saying what [a] must be
   fresh for. Three readings of "[P] holds of a fresh name" agree when
   [P] depends on finitely many names only, its support:
   - [P] holds of every name outside some finite set ([for_fresh]);
   - [P] holds of every name outside the support;
   - [P] holds of some name outside the support.
   That they agree is [some_any_statement]. One proves the third (choose
   one fresh name and show [P] of it) and uses the second (it then holds
   of whichever fresh name is at hand).

   The definition. [for_fresh P] is that there is a list of names off
   which [P] holds. The reasons for this form.
   - It names no support, which is the point of the quantifier. The
     second and third readings above each need one.
   - The list bounds the exceptions and need not be exactly the names at
     which [P] fails. So nothing asks that [P] be decidable, and no law
     below needs the excluded middle: no statement here depends on an
     axiom. "The set of names at which [P] fails is finite" would need
     both.
   - It is a proposition. A proof of it cannot be asked for a name, and
     nothing here computes: the functions that are extracted take the
     names to avoid and call [fresh_name]
     (FlambdaNameAbstractionSpec.v). The quantifier is for stating what
     is true of their results.
   It is the cofinite quantification of locally nameless developments
   (Aydemir, Chargueraud, Pierce, Pollack and Weirich, "Engineering
   formal metatheory", 2008), with names in place of indices.

   The notation. The letter is the Cyrillic capital I, U+0418, as in the
   papers. For Rocq it is a letter and not a symbol, so the notation
   makes it a keyword, as Rocq's own Utf8_core does for the Greek letter
   of its notation for functions, and a blank must follow it: [И a, P a].
   It takes binders as [∀] does: [И a b, P] is [И a, И b, P]. A line is
   measured in characters, of which the letter is one.

   Which laws need a support. In the papers every predicate has a finite
   support, because the logic is that of nominal sets. In Rocq a
   predicate on names can be anything: it can look at the order of
   names, for one, and then [И a b, a < b] holds and [И b a, a < b] does
   not ([for_fresh_swap_needs_support_statement]). So the support is a
   premise of the laws that need it, said with [supports]: a permutation
   that fixes the names of the support keeps the predicate.
   - No support is needed for introduction and elimination, for
     monotonicity (modus ponens under the quantifier), for conjunction,
     for a proposition that does not mention the name, and for one
     direction each of disjunction, negation, [∀] and [∃].
   - A support is needed for the agreement of the three readings, for
     the other direction of disjunction and negation, for implication as
     an equivalence, and for exchanging two quantified names.
   Two names quantified one after the other are different names
   ([for_fresh_distinct_statement]).

   With the interface of FlambdaNameAbstractionSpec.v: the propositions
   are a type that contains no names, with [<->] as its equality
   ([propositions]); a predicate of a name and a value is then a function
   to which [equivariant] and [respects_equal] apply as they stand, and
   such a predicate, at a value, is supported by the free names of the
   value ([equivariant_supports_statement]). So for an equivariant
   predicate the three readings agree with the free names of its
   argument as the support ([some_any_nominal_statement]).

   Several names at once. A binder of Flambda 2 may bind a list of
   names (the parameters of a handler, the continuations of a recursive
   group), and what is fresh for it is a list of as many names, all
   different. [И[n] names, P names] says that [P] holds of every list of
   [n] different names outside some finite set ([for_fresh_names]). It
   gives the quantifier taken [n] times, one name after another
   ([for_fresh_names_next_statement]), and is the same thing for a
   predicate with a support ([for_fresh_names_iterated_statement]); the
   three readings agree for it too ([some_any_names_statement]).

   Nothing here mentions the terms of Flambda 2. Nothing is trusted. The
   proofs are in FlambdaFreshQuantifierProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
