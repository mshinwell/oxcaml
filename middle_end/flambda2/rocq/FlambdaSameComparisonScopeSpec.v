(* Making a [Phys_equal] of a simple against itself its answer keeps
   scope.

   This file is to be reviewed: the statement, against
   FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceSpec.keeps_scope and
   FlambdaSameComparisonSpec.fold_same_comparisons.

   The proof that the validator answers the same of renamed terms goes
   rewrite by rewrite, and uses of each that it keeps scope: on a term
   whose code is closed the code of the result is closed, and no
   variable or continuation is free in the result that is not free in
   the term. The pass puts a constant in the place of a primitive and
   changes nothing else, so no name is free in the result that is not
   free in the term.

   The statement is in a file of its own, and not in
   FlambdaSameComparisonSpec.v, because [keeps_scope] is defined after
   the validator, which applies the rewrite.

   The proof is in FlambdaSameComparisonScopeProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
