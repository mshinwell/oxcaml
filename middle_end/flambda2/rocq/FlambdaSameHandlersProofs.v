(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaSameHandlersSpec.v. Nothing here
   needs review.

   Down the body of the [Let_cont] that binds [k], the environments are
   those of that [Let_cont] but for the names bound on the way. A
   handler that passes the test is the same as that of [k] up to bound
   names and has none of those names free, so its closure matches that
   of [k] (FlambdaCompareProofs.cont_matches): applied to the same
   values the two come to states that are equivalent
   (FlambdaCompareProofs.apply_cont_value_match). The handler that is
   put in its place binds its parameters and applies [k] to them, which
   is the closure of [k] applied to the values given. So the two
   closures of the continuation whose handler is replaced apply alike,
   and one may stand for the other in any body
   (FlambdaContAlikeProofs.let_cont_handler_alike). Each layer of the
   term is a context around that
   (FlambdaContextProofs.plug_equivalent). *)
