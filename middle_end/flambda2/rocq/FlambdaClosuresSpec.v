(* Sets of closures of several functions: first facts.

   This file is to be reviewed: the statements, against the meaning given
   to the closures of a set in FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v ([closure_of],
   [closure_in_set], [project_function_slot]), against the two derived
   forms of FlambdaModel.v ([let_closures], [bind_closures]) and what they
   stand for in the compiler (the [Let] with the bound pattern
   [Bound_pattern.Set_of_closures], and the static binding with the
   pattern [Bound_static.Pattern.Set_of_closures]), and against what
   Simplify knows of a set (simplify/simplify_set_of_closures.ml, where
   each closure gets the type [T.exactly_this_closure], in which the
   closure at every slot of the set is the name bound to it).

   - [let_closures] binds each of its variables to the closure of the set
     at that variable's slot ([let_closures_runs_statement]), in as many
     steps as there are variables; it is undefined where a value slot has
     no value ([let_closures_undefined_statement]).
   - [bind_closures] binds each of its symbols to the closure of the set at
     that symbol's slot ([bind_closures_binds_statement]); once so bound
     ([static_set_bound]) the set stays bound, as nothing static is bound
     twice, and the projection of a function slot from one of its symbols
     is the symbol of that slot ([project_static_set_statement]).
   - The projection of a function slot from a closure whose set is in
     sight is what is bound at that slot: a variable of the [Let]
     ([project_function_slot_let_closures_statement]), a symbol of the
     static binding ([project_function_slot_static_statement]); and the
     projection of a value slot is what the set gives the slot
     ([project_value_slot_static_statement]). This is what Simplify does
     to a projection from a closure of known type.
   - A call of the closure projected from a closure of a set is a direct
     call of the code of the slot ([apply_sibling_statement]): how a
     function of a set calls another, through [my_closure].
   - In a set whose functions have each their own code, the code of a
     closure says which slot it is at
     ([closure_code_determines_slot_statement]). It does not say which
     set: two sets may have the same code.
   - Two units in which two functions call each other through their set
     and read a value slot of it, one with the set made by a [Let] and
     one static, end as they should ([parity_let_statement],
     [parity_static_statement]): the statements above are not about terms
     that are all undefined. Both units are well-formed
     ([parity_well_formed_statement]). A third binds one only of the two
     symbols of the static set, and is not
     ([partial_static_set_statement]).

   The static statements ask that the set is bound as [bind_closures]
   binds it. The semantics does not enforce that of a static environment:
   a symbol may be bound to a closure that names, as the symbol of
   another slot, a symbol bound to anything, or to nothing. A well-formed
   unit (FlambdaWellFormedSpec.well_formed_unit) does not do that:
   - in every state of its run, the symbols of every static set are bound
     to the closures of the set ([well_formed_sets_bound_statement],
     [static_sets_bound]), and then the projection of a function slot,
     where it has a value, is a closure of the same set at the slot asked
     for ([project_function_slot_bound_statement]);
   - it never makes a closure at a function slot that its set has not
     got, which the machine makes undefined
     ([well_formed_makes_closures_statement]).
   Statements about all environments, such as those above with
   [expr_equivalent], hold also of environments that no well-formed unit
   reaches. There they say what the machine does, which is a choice
   (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v); they need no premise to be true, and a
   statement that is true only of sets that are bound takes
   [static_set_bound] or [static_sets_bound] as a premise.

   Such environments may also hold values of the shape of a closure of a
   set that no term makes: at a function slot that its set has not got,
   or of a set in which a function slot or a code id is given twice. A
   value is valid ([value_valid]) when no closure in it is so, and what a
   symbol is bound to is valid ([allocated_valid]) when the values in it
   are and, for a closure of a static set, the set is so made and names a
   symbol for each of its function slots. This is about the shape of
   values only, not about whether the code or the symbols they name are
   bound.
   - A valid value that is a closure is at a function slot of a set whose
     function slots are distinct and whose functions have each their own
     code ([closure_in_set_valid_statement]); so the code it runs says
     which slot it is at ([closure_code_determines_slot_statement]).
   - Where what the symbols are bound to is valid, the projection of a
     function slot from a closure at the slot named has a value whenever
     the set has the slot asked for
     ([project_function_slot_valid_statement]).
   - Evaluation makes valid values out of valid ones: a defining
     expression whose set is well-formed ([eval_named_valid_statement]),
     a static constant whose binding passes the check of static sets
     ([eval_static_const_valid_statement]).
   - Every state of the run of a well-formed unit holds valid values
     only, and the run ends with valid values
     ([well_formed_values_valid_statement],
     [well_formed_exit_valid_statement]). So a well-formed unit never
     holds a value of the shapes above, and the facts about valid values
     hold wherever it goes. In particular a closure that it calls is at
     the only slot of its set that has the code called
     ([well_formed_closure_slot_statement]).
   - What the run keeps, of which these are consequences, is stated on
     states, so that a statement about a state of such a run can take it
     as a premise. [sets_inv]: the sets of every term that the state
     holds are well-formed, and its static sets are bound. The state
     that a unit starts in has it where the sets of the unit are
     well-formed ([sets_inv_initial_statement]), a step keeps it
     ([sets_inv_step_statement]), so every state of the run of a
     well-formed unit has it ([well_formed_sets_inv_statement]); and
     from a state that has it, a step keeps the values valid
     ([state_valid_step_statement]).
   - A call binds [my_closure] to the closure called, where [my_closure]
     is not also a parameter of the code
     ([call_binds_my_closure_statement]). The code that the run of a
     well-formed unit binds has distinct binders
     ([well_formed_code_binders_statement]), so in such a run a call of
     a closure that has a step, and is not a partial application, runs
     the body of its code with [my_closure] bound to the closure called
     ([well_formed_call_binds_my_closure_statement]), which is at the
     slot of that code.

   The code of a closure does not say which set the closure belongs to,
   and a rewrite inside the code of a function that uses what is known
   of the other closures of its set needs to know. [sets_are] is a test
   on a unit: every set that it makes with a given code is the one set
   given, static with given symbols if that is asked.
   - Every state of the run of a unit that passes the test holds
     closures of that set only with that code
     ([sets_are_kept_statement]), so a closure of the code is a closure
     of the set ([closure_of_code_statement]). The unit need not be
     well-formed.
   - If it is, a closure of the code is at the slot of the code, the
     projection of each other function slot of the set from it has a
     value, and that value is a closure of the code of that slot, with
     the same value slots ([sibling_of_code_statement]). Where the set
     is static, the closure is the symbol of its slot and the projection
     is the symbol of the other slot
     ([sibling_symbol_of_code_statement]), and the symbols of the set
     are bound to its closures ([set_of_code_bound_statement]), which is
     the premise [static_set_bound] of [project_static_set_statement].
   - The two example units pass the test ([parity_sets_are_statement]).

   The proofs are in FlambdaClosuresProofs.v, which needs no review. *)

   call each other: [even n] is 1 at 0 and [odd (n - 1)] otherwise, and
   [odd n] is 0 at 0 and [even (n - 1)] otherwise. There is no arithmetic
   (the primitives are abstract): the [Switch] gives the predecessor. A
   function reaches the other by projecting its function slot from
   [my_closure], and reads its answer at 0 from a value slot of the set,
   also through [my_closure]. Numbers and answers are naked immediates,
   and the code, the handlers and the calls say so. *)
