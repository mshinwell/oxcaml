(* The unboxing of variants commutes with renaming, and keeps scope.

   This file is to be reviewed: [rename_read] and the statements.

   FlambdaUnboxVariantsSpec.unbox_variant_params, like the pass of
   FlambdaUnboxParamsSpec.v, goes through a term carrying what is known
   of its variables, compares names by equality only, and binds no name
   that the term has not got: the variable that becomes a parameter was
   bound by the [Let] that goes, and what an application is given is a
   constant or something in scope. So it commutes with the renamings of
   FlambdaNominalSpec.v, in the forms of
   FlambdaUnboxParamsRenameSpec.v, which this file follows:
   - an expression with its applications extended by a function of
     their arguments ([extend_applications_by]) is renamed when what is
     known, the continuation and the expression are, if the function
     commutes with renaming;
   - an expression with the arms taken that known numbers lead to
     ([take_arms]) is renamed when the variables of which the numbers
     are known ([rename_immediates]) and the expression are;
   - the arguments that [extend_args_certain] gives are renamed when
     the parameters, the two handlers, what is known and the arguments
     are; the test that an application does not come to a read answers
     the same, as the removal of unused continuations and the
     comparison commute with renaming;
   - the first read of a parameter by a primitive that is wanted
     ([first_read]) is the first read of the renamed expression,
     renamed ([rename_read]): the variable and the expression without
     the [Let] are renamed, and the kind, the primitive and the
     position are as they were;
   - the pass given what is known ([unbox_variants_knowing]) gives the
     renamed result when what is known is renamed with the term;
   - the pass with nothing known is a rewrite that takes a term and
     nothing else ([unbox_variant_params_equivariant_statement], which
     is [rewrite_equivariant unbox_variant_params]).

   Each of these statements is an equation and holds of every term.

   The pass also keeps scope
   (FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceSpec.keeps_scope): on a term whose code
   is closed, the code of the result is closed and every variable or
   continuation that is free in the result is free in the term. The
   variable that becomes a parameter is bound in all of the handler,
   where it was bound below the [Let] only; the test that it is not
   free in the handler is what makes the pass refine the term, and is
   not needed for this.

   With these two and [unbox_variant_params_refines] the pass can take
   the place of [unbox_known_params] in a round of the validation.

   The proofs are in FlambdaUnboxVariantsRenameProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
