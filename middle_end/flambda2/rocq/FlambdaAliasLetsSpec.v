(* A [Let] of a variable to the variable that the [Let] around it has
   just bound, where that variable is not free in what follows: the two
   are made one [Let]. A normalisation that is an equivalence.

   This file is to be reviewed: [merge_alias_lets], which is extracted
   and run by the validation of middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/ on
   the term after Simplify (FlambdaValidateSpec.normalise_expr_after
   and [normalise_after_round]), and the statement.

   The validation inlines the calls of known code in the term after as
   in the term before (FlambdaNormaliseSpec.inline_known_calls). The
   copy of the body of the code returns by applying the continuation
   that the call returned to. Once that continuation is inlined where
   it is applied, the copy ends with a [Let] of the parameter of the
   continuation to the variable that the body returns:

     let x = d in      the last thing that the body computes
     let y = x in      the result of the call, by the name that the
     rest              continuation gives it

   FlambdaAliasesSpec.follow_aliases then puts x for y in the rest,
   and the [Let] of y, left unused, is removed. It cannot do so where
   the rest binds x again, and it does where the same code is inlined
   at a second call in the rest: a body that is inlined twice is copied
   with the names that it binds, the round of the term after renames
   nothing apart (the round of the term before does,
   FlambdaRenameApartSpec.rename_apart_avoiding), and what is known of
   y is forgotten under the second binding of x. The [Let] of y then
   stays in the term after, and the term before has none.

   [merge_alias_lets] makes the two [Let]s one,

     let y = d in rest

   where the defining expression of the inner [Let] is the variable of
   the outer one, the two [Let]s are at the same kind, and the variable
   of the outer one is not free in the body of the inner one
   (FlambdaNormaliseSpec.var_free_b; the body may bind a variable of
   that name again and use it). It is applied before the aliases are
   followed, when x is not yet free in the rest. The body of the inner
   [Let] is rewritten first, so of three such [Let]s one is left. The
   handlers of non-recursive
   continuations are gone into; the handlers of recursive ones and the
   bodies of code are left as they are
   (FlambdaNormaliseSpec.rewrite_rec_handlers and [rewrite_code] take a
   rewrite there).

   The two kinds must be the same: a [Let] has no step unless the
   value of its defining expression is of its kind
   (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.step), so where the kinds differ the two
   [Let]s are undefined whatever d is, and the one [Let] may not be.

   The result is equivalent to the term
   ([merge_alias_lets_equivalent_statement]), under all environments.

   Renaming: the pass compares variables for equality and makes no
   name, and it commutes with the renamings of FlambdaNominalSpec.v
   ([merge_alias_lets_renamed_statement]).

   The proof is in FlambdaAliasLetsProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
