(* The identities of integer arithmetic that Simplify applies, and the
   comparison of a variable with itself: a normalisation that refines.

   This file is to be reviewed: [apply_identities] and what it is made
   of, and the statement. The pass is meant for the validation of
   middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/, as one of the normalisations
   of the term before Simplify (FlambdaValidateSpec.v). It is not yet
   among them, and it is not yet extracted: until a later change puts
   it there, nothing runs it.

   Simplify computes an arithmetic operation or a shift of two integers
   that it knows. Where it knows one of the two only, it applies an
   identity of the operation, if the integer it knows has one
   ([Simplify_binary_primitive]: [Int_ops_for_binary_arith], with
   [symmetric_op_one_side_unknown], [op_lhs_unknown] and
   [op_rhs_unknown], and [Int_ops_for_binary_shift]). The result is the
   other argument, a constant, the opposite of the other argument,
   written [0 - x], or its complement. With [x] for the argument that
   is not known:

   - [x + 0], [0 + x], [x - 0], [x * 1], [1 * x], [x / 1], [x land -1],
     [-1 land x], [x lor 0], [0 lor x], [x lxor 0], [0 lxor x] and a
     shift of [x] by 0 are [x];
   - [x * 0], [0 * x], [x land 0], [0 land x], [x mod 1], the signed
     [x mod -1] and a shift of 0 by [x] are 0;
   - [x lor -1], [-1 lor x] and the arithmetic shift right of -1 by [x]
     are -1;
   - [x * -1], [-1 * x] and the signed [x / -1] are [0 - x], which is
     also what [0 - x] is made into: that one is left as it is;
   - [x lxor -1] and [-1 lxor x] are the complement of [x], the unary
     [Int_arith] with [Not].

   The functions below are Simplify's, with its names, on integers. Its
   divisions and remainders by 0, which it makes [Invalid], are not
   here: they are left as they are. Simplify has no identity for an
   operation on a variable and itself ([x - x], [x lxor x], [x lor x]),
   and there is none here.

   Simplify also computes [Phys_equal] of two arguments that it proves
   to be the same value or different ones
   ([Simplify_binary_primitive.simplify_phys_equal], with
   [Provers.prove_physical_equality]). One of its proofs needs nothing
   but the term: two arguments that are the same variable are the same
   value, so [Phys_eq] of them is 1 and [Phys_neq] is 0. That one is
   here. (It says the same of a symbol and itself, and that two symbols
   are different; neither is here, as [Phys_equal] has no value on two
   allocated values, FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.eval_phys_equal.)

   This normalisation uses no types: it does the same where the integer
   that is known is a constant of the term, of the kind of the
   operation, and the other argument is not a constant. An operation on
   two constants is left alone: computing it is another normalisation
   (FlambdaNormaliseSpec.fold_constants). A [Let] of such an operation
   becomes a [Let] of what the identity gives ([identity_named]), with
   the kind it had. Nothing else is rewritten, and the [Let] stays, as in
   FlambdaBlockLoadSpec.v, which this file follows: a handler of a
   non-recursive continuation is gone into; the handlers of recursive
   ones and the bodies of code are left as they are.

   The result refines the term ([apply_identities_refines_statement]).
   Each identity is true of every integer in the range of the kind,
   wrapping included, and an operation has a value on integers of its
   kind, in range, only (FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.int_of_value): so where
   the operation has a value, what replaces it has the same. It is not
   an equivalence: where the other argument is not an integer of the
   kind the operation has no value, and a constant, or the other
   argument, has one; and [Phys_equal] has no value on a variable that
   holds an allocated value.

   The proofs are in FlambdaIdentitiesProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
