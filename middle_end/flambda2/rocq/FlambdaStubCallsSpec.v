(* In the code of a stub, the direct calls of the unit's other code are
   made indirect, as Simplify makes them. A normalisation that refines.

   This file is to be reviewed: [demote_stub_calls] and what it is made
   of, against what Simplify does (below), and the statements, the last
   three of which are computed: the rewrite on a small unit, with the
   code of its wrapper a stub and not, and a call that the rewrite
   gives a step that it had not. [demote_stub_calls] is extracted and
   run by the validation of
   middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/, on the term before.

   What Simplify does. Code says whether it is a stub
   (FlambdaModel.code_is_stub, the compiler's [Code.stub]). The
   function that a partial application of a known function becomes is
   one (from_lambda/closure_conversion.ml, [wrap_partial_application]):
   its closure keeps the function in a value slot, and its code
   projects the slot from [my_closure] and calls what it gets, by a
   direct call of the code of the function. Unless
   [-flambda2-simplify-stubs] is given, and by default it is not
   (driver/oxcaml_flags.ml), Simplify does not simplify the code of a
   stub where it simplifies the set of closures that the code is of,
   as it does other code (simplify/simplify_set_of_closures.ml,
   [simplify_function]). It simplifies it once, where the code is
   bound (simplify/simplify_static_const.ml, by
   [Simplify_set_of_closures.simplify_static_stub_function]). There
   [my_closure] has an unknown type
   (simplify/simplify_set_of_closures.ml, [dacc_inside_function], the
   case of no function slot), and nothing is inlined
   ([DE.enter_stub_function]). So, in the code of a stub (discrepancy
   C3-11):
   - the projection of a value slot from [my_closure] stays as it is:
     Simplify does not know there what the slot holds;
   - a direct call whose callee is such a projection has a callee
     whose type is not available, and where it names code of the unit
     that is not a stub it becomes an indirect call of known arity
     (simplify/simplify_apply_expr.ml,
     [simplify_function_call_where_callee's_type_unavailable], the
     case [Direct code_id]). The code that a unit binds, its stubs
     excepted, is never simplified as it stands: each set of closures
     is given a new version of it, and the old is not to be kept alive
     by a call that names it ([DA.code_ids_never_simplified]; the
     reason is at its definition, in
     simplify/simplify_static_const.ml). A direct call that names the
     code of another stub, or code that the unit does not bind, keeps
     its code id. So does one that names code which says that it is a
     newer version of other code ([Code.newer_version_of]): Simplify
     leaves that code out of the set too. The code that the front end
     makes does not say it (from_lambda/closure_conversion.ml).

   What is here. [demote_stub_calls e] makes indirect, in the code of
   each stub that the unit [e] binds, every direct call that names
   code which [e] binds and which is not a stub ([non_stub_code]). The
   [Indirect] of the model is both sorts of indirect call of the
   compiler (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v, the comment at
   [shape_of_closure_call]). Every such call of that code is made
   indirect, whatever its callee. Simplify does it where the type of
   the callee is not available. Where the type says which closure the
   callee is, Simplify keeps the call direct, and the validation makes
   direct again the call that this has made indirect: for a variable
   that a [Let] of the stub binds to a [Set_of_closures] whose value
   slots do not hold the variable
   (../types/rocq/FlambdaAliasesSpec.follow_aliases, by
   [typing_env_under_let]), and for a symbol that the unit binds,
   outside code, to a closure
   (FlambdaKnownSymbolsSpec.fold_known_unit). [follow_aliases] does
   not do it for a variable that a [Let] binds to a [Closure_of_set],
   however many functions the set has, and a unit that has such a
   call in the code of a stub may not be validated. The model has not
   got what code is a newer version of, so that code is not left out
   of [non_stub_code]: in a unit written by hand that has it, the
   rewrite makes indirect a call that Simplify leaves direct, and the
   unit may not be validated. Everything else is left: code that is
   not a stub, and what is outside code.

   It refines, under all environments, and rests on no invariant
   ([demote_stub_calls_refines_statement]): a direct call is the
   indirect call of the same callee with the same arguments, made
   undefined where the callee is not a closure of the code named
   (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.shape_of_closure_call). So a direct call that
   has a step has that step once made indirect
   ([demote_call_step_statement]). It is not an equivalence: a direct
   call that names other code than that of its callee is undefined,
   and the indirect call runs ([demote_call_defines_statement]).
   Nothing is believed of the flag: the rewrite refines whatever code
   the flag is set on.

   This file does not say that the other rewrites of the validation
   leave the code of a stub as Simplify does; each says so of itself.
   FlambdaKnownSlotsSpec.read_slots reads no value slot there.

   The proofs are in FlambdaStubCallsProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
