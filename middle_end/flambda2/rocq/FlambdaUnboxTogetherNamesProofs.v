(* FlambdaUnboxTogetherSpec.unbox_together_knowing commutes with
   renaming and keeps scope: the lemmas from which
   FlambdaUnboxVariantsRenameProofs.v, FlambdaUnboxInScopeRenameProofs.v
   and FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceProofs.v prove the statements. There
   is no statement here, and nothing here needs review.

   The pass compares names by equality only and makes none. So each of
   its functions gives, on a renamed term and with what is known
   renamed, the renamed result: the rewrite and the test for renamed
   positions, and the positions that the pass uses, which are computed
   from the term; the sorts of box that a term unboxes are those of
   the term renamed. For the scope: the parameters of a handler are
   the same in another order; the [Let] of a parameter mentions the
   variable that the unboxing mentioned; and an argument is one that
   the application had, a constant, or a variable of what is known,
   which is in scope where the application is. *)
