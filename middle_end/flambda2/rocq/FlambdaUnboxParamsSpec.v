(* Unboxing a parameter of a continuation that every application gives
   something known: a normalisation that refines.

   This file is to be reviewed: [unbox_known_params] and what it is made
   of, and the statement. Nothing runs the pass yet: it is not among
   the normalisations of FlambdaValidateSpec.v.

   Simplify unboxes the parameters of a continuation
   (simplify/unboxing/): where the type of a parameter says that it is
   a block of one tag and size, a variant or a boxed or tagged number,
   the continuation gets one more parameter for each field, for the tag,
   for whether the value is an immediate, or for the number, and every
   application gets the matching arguments
   ([Unbox_continuation_params.make_decisions],
   [compute_extra_params_and_args]; [Apply_cont_rewrite.make_rewrite]
   adds them, the new parameters after those the continuation had). In
   the handler the type of the old parameter is made to say that its
   fields are the new parameters ([Build_unboxing_denv.denv_of_decision]),
   so that every load of a field there becomes the new parameter; the
   old parameter goes if nothing else uses it, and with it the
   allocation at an application that made the block only to pass it.
   What an application gives for a new parameter is the field itself
   where its type knows it ([Unboxing_epa.unbox_arg]: an
   [Already_in_scope] argument), and a load made before the application
   where it does not (a [New_let_binding] of [Unboxers.Field.unboxing_prim],
   [%block_load] with the tag and the size of the decision).

   [unbox_known_params] does the first of the two, where it can be
   read off the term. At a non-recursive [Let_cont] whose handler
   begins with a [Let] of a variable [f] to a primitive that reads a
   box ([reads_a_box]: a load not marked [Mutable], [Is_int],
   [Get_tag], [Unbox_number], [Untag_immediate]) applied to a parameter
   [x], it removes that [Let] and makes [f] one more parameter, the
   last; and it gives every application of the continuation in the
   body of the [Let_cont] one more argument, the last: what the
   primitive is known to give of the argument that the application has
   for [x] ([projection_of]). That is known in three ways, each a
   function of another file, where the conditions are:
   - the argument is a variable bound by a [Let] to a [Make_block], or
     a symbol bound to a static block
     (FlambdaBlockLoadSpec.load_known_named): a load gives what the
     field holds, [Is_int] no, [Get_tag] the tag;
   - the argument is a variable bound by a [Let] to a [Box_number] or
     a [Tag_immediate], or a symbol bound to a static boxed number
     (FlambdaUnboxSpec.unbox_known_named): the unboxing or the
     untagging gives what was wrapped;
   - the argument is a constant on which the primitive has a value
     that is a constant (FlambdaNormaliseSpec.fold_named): [Is_int] of
     a tagged immediate, an untagging.
   Then it does the same for the [Let] that the handler now begins
   with ([unbox_heads]), so a handler that begins by reading several
   fields of a parameter, or a field of a field, has them all made
   parameters, in the order in which it reads them. The parameter that
   was read stays, with its arguments: where the handler no longer uses
   it, removing it is another pass's.

   What stops it, for one [Let] and those after it:
   - an application of the continuation whose argument is not known in
     one of the three ways. No [Let] is added at an application: the
     pass makes no name, and an arm of a [Switch] has no place for
     one. So a parameter that some application gives a value from
     elsewhere (a parameter of the function, the result of a call) is
     left boxed, where Simplify adds a load. That is also what stops
     it for a primitive that does not read a box: [projection_of]
     gives no argument for an application. The pass does not look at
     the primitive otherwise, so the [Let] at the head of a handler
     that the body never applies becomes a parameter whatever its
     unary primitive is, and nothing gives it an argument;
   - an [Apply] in the scope of the continuation that returns to it or
     raises to it: the call applies the continuation to values that
     the term does not show;
   - an exception handler, which Simplify does not unbox either;
   - parameters that are not distinct, or not as many as the kinds of
     the metadata; a [Let] of a name that is already a parameter;
   - a recursive [Let_cont]: its handlers are left as they are, and so
     are the bodies of code (FlambdaNormaliseSpec.rewrite_code takes
     the pass into code, with nothing known there). The applications
     that are inside the handlers of a recursive [Let_cont], or of any
     other continuation, in the scope of the continuation being
     unboxed are given their argument like the others.

   Scopes. An application of the same name under a binding of that
   name by another [Let_cont] is an application of that other
   continuation and is left alone ([extend_applications] stops there).
   What is known of a variable is forgotten under a binder of it, as in
   the two files that say what is known. Nothing is asked of the names
   of the term.

   The result refines the term ([unbox_known_params_refines_statement]),
   under all environments. It is not claimed to be equivalent to it,
   and here is a case in which it is not: a static block may hold a
   field that is not of the kind of values, as nothing tests the
   fields of a static block when it is bound. The load of such a
   field in the handler has no value; the argument at the application
   is the field itself (FlambdaBlockLoadSpec.field_loaded gives what
   the field holds, whatever its kind), and a new parameter of the
   kind of the field takes it, so the term after runs where the term
   before is undefined. So the pass is for the term before Simplify.

   What it is not: it does not decide as Simplify decides. Simplify
   unboxes by the type of the parameter, to a bounded depth, and only
   where that is of use; this pass goes by what the handler reads
   first. Where the two differ the validation fails; it never accepts
   more. The new parameters are in the order of the [Let]s of the
   handler, and Simplify's are in the reverse of the order of the
   fields ([Continuation_extra_params_and_args.add] puts each new
   parameter first): the two agree where the source reads the fields
   last to first, as the pattern matching of the front end does.

   Renaming: the functions here compare names by equality only and bind
   none that the term has not got. FlambdaUnboxParamsRenameSpec.v has
   the statement that the pass commutes with a renaming.

   [extend_applications_by] is [extend_applications] with the new
   arguments given by a function; the pass does not use it.
   FlambdaUnboxVariantsSpec.v does, for a parameter that is read under
   a test.

   The proofs are in FlambdaUnboxParamsProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
