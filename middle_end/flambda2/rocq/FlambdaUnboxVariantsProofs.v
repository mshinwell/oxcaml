(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaUnboxVariantsSpec.v. Nothing here
   needs review.

   Giving a continuation one more parameter and every application one
   more argument is the simulation of FlambdaUnboxParamsProofs.v
   ([unbox_parameter_refines]), which asks two things: of the new
   argument, that it has a value of the kind of the parameter which
   the primitive gives of the parameter read, if it gives one; and of
   the two handlers, that the one without the [Let] refines the other
   when its new parameter holds such a value ([read_refines], by the
   lemmas of contexts, with no simulation of its own). Here are the
   first for the arguments of [extend_args_certain], that
   [first_read] finds a [Let] of which the second holds, and the
   pass. *)
