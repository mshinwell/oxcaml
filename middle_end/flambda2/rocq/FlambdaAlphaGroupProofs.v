(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaAlphaGroupSpec.v. Nothing here
   needs review.

   The rule read both ways. Exchanging the continuations of a group for
   fresh ones is a renaming that fixes the free names of the whole
   term, so each term is alpha-equivalent to the one whose group binds
   the fresh names ([group_opened]). Two such terms bind the same
   continuations. From left to right the comparison accepts them, so
   it accepts the handlers one by one and the bodies with no names
   paired ([group_eqb_alpha]), and what it accepts is alpha-equivalent
   (FlambdaCompareConverseProofs.v, FlambdaAlphaFreshProofs.v). From
   right to left the body is replaced under the group, and then the
   handlers one after another ([alpha_handlers_group]).

   The abstraction. A handler is equal to another when it has the same
   metadata and is equal as an abstraction of its parameters; that
   relation is an equivalence by the laws of abstractions
   (FlambdaNameAbstractionProofs.abstraction_nominal), and the other
   laws, which are about continuations, come from those of closed
   expressions, the two sorts of renaming being independent
   ([rename_sorts_commute]). The theorem is proved as those of
   FlambdaNominalInstancesProofs.v are: each side is opened by its
   permutation, which is a renaming of the whole term that fixes its
   free names, and the two opened terms bind the same continuations
   and have equal scopes. *)
