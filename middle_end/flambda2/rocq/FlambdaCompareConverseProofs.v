(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaCompareConverseSpec.v. Nothing
   here needs review.

   The recursion is on the first term, and the statement proved is of
   the term under any renaming, since at a binder the scope is renamed
   before it is compared again. Each case is a lemma that takes what
   the recursion gives for the parts of the term; the recursion itself
   is the last proof of the file.

   At a binder: take fresh names for both sides ([fresh_opens_at]);
   the scopes, with the bound names of each side exchanged for them,
   are accepted with no names paired ([opened_eqb]: the comparison
   accepts each scope against its renaming, and is symmetric and
   transitive under maps that compose); the recursion gives that they
   are alpha-equivalent; and the rule that compares two binders at the
   same names concludes. Where there is no binder the comparison with
   no names paired is equality. *)
