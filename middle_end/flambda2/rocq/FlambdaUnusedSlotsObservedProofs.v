(* Proofs of the statement of FlambdaUnusedSlotsObservedSpec.v. Nothing
   here needs review.

   The simulation is that of FlambdaUnusedSlotsProofs.v, from a first
   state with a continuation environment of what may follow a unit.
   What may follow binds nothing static, so the rewrite leaves it as it
   is and the second state has the same continuations; and it projects
   none of the slots removed, which is what the invariant of the first
   run asks of the handlers that a state holds. *)
