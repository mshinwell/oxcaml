(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaCanonicalFreeNamesSpec.v. This file
   needs no review.

   Each statement is proved from its older form, a lemma of
   FlambdaNominalProofs.v or of FlambdaAlphaProofs.v, with the premise
   about names turned by [var_free_among] and [cont_free_among]: what is
   free by the relation is among the list, so a renaming that fixes the
   list fixes it ([variables_fixed] and the lemmas beside it, in
   FlambdaAlphaProofs.v), and a name that is not among the list is not
   free. *)
