(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaUnusedSlotsSpec.v. Nothing here
   needs review.

   The unit and the unit without the slots are run side by side, in
   step. The second state is the first with the slots removed from the
   static sets of closures of its terms and from the closures that its
   symbols are bound to ([trim_state]); the values of its variables are
   those of the first. Nothing of the first run reads a slot removed:
   its terms have no projection of one, which a run keeps
   (FlambdaClosuresProofs.terms_inv_step), and no primitive looks at
   the value slots of a closure
   (FlambdaPrimitiveProofs.eval_prim_related, with equality for the
   relation). *)
