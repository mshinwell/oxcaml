(* What the unit binds a symbol to is known wherever the symbol is used:
   a primitive or a projection applied to symbols bound to constants is
   replaced by its value.

   This file is to be reviewed: [known_bindings], [fold_known] and what
   they are made of, against what Simplify does (below); [bound_as], the
   check; [fold_known_unit], which is extracted and run by the validation
   of middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/; and the statements.

   What Simplify does. A symbol has a type from where it is bound to the
   end of the unit, in code too, and that type says what it is bound to:
   the closures of a static set with their symbols and what their value
   slots hold, the tag and the fields of a static block, the contents of
   a boxed number (simplify/simplify_static_const.ml and
   simplify/lifting/, which give the symbols of a group their types
   before the rest of the unit is simplified). So, wherever such a
   symbol is an argument: the projection of a function slot from the
   symbol of a closure is the symbol of the other closure of the set
   (simplify/simplify_unary_primitive.ml,
   [simplify_project_function_slot]); the projection of a value slot is
   what the slot holds ([simplify_project_value_slot]); a load from a
   static block is its field, and [Is_int] and [Get_tag] of one are
   their answers ([simplify_immutable_block_load] and the like). In the
   code of a function whose closure is a symbol, [my_closure] is that
   symbol (FlambdaMyClosureSpec.v), so the code of two functions that
   call each other comes to call through the two symbols. And an
   indirect call of such a symbol is made a direct call of the code of
   its closure (simplify/simplify_apply_expr.ml,
   [simplify_function_call], which reads the closure off the type of
   the callee): so where a function that is given a function of the
   unit is inlined, the call of its argument is direct, and may be
   inlined in turn.

   What is here. [known_bindings e] are the symbols that the unit [e]
   binds, outside code, to a constant with no variable in it: one whose
   fields or value slots are symbols and constants. Such a constant has
   one value whatever the environment ([known_statics]). [fold_known]
   replaces, in the whole unit, in code and in handlers too, the
   defining expression of a [Let] whose arguments are constants and
   such symbols, and which has under [known_statics] a value that is a
   constant or a symbol, by that value ([fold_known_named]). Of a
   closure of a static set whose value slots hold variables, less is
   known, and it is known whatever they hold: its function slot, and
   the symbols and the functions of the set ([known_sets]). That is
   what the projection of a function slot reads, so one from such a
   symbol is replaced by the symbol of the other closure
   ([fold_function_slot]); and it says which code the closure is of, so
   an indirect call of such a symbol is made a direct call of that code
   ([fold_known_apply]). Of a static block one of whose fields is a
   variable, the tag and the other fields are known, whatever the
   variable holds ([known_sets] lists the block with [unknown_field]
   for such a field): a load of a field that is a symbol or a constant
   is replaced by it ([fold_block_load]), as Simplify replaces one from
   the type of the block
   (simplify/simplify_unary_primitive.ml,
   [simplify_immutable_block_load]). That is how the code of a function
   comes to call a function of a module of the unit by its symbol,
   where the module also holds a value computed when the unit runs.
   The value
   is computed by the evaluation of the machine itself
   (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.eval_named), so there is no list of primitives
   here, and nothing to keep in step with them. The one primitive that
   the normalisation never folds is not folded here either
   (FlambdaNormaliseSpec.prim_may_fold: [Opaque_identity], which
   Simplify leaves alone). Nor is the load of bytes from a string
   ([reads_string]): Simplify does not compute it
   ([Simplify_binary_primitive.simplify_string_or_bigstring_load]), so
   the term after keeps the load, and with the load kept here the two
   terms have it. No primitive of the model has an effect;
   one that allocates something with an identity, or reads what may
   change, must be left out too when the model has them.

   It is right where each symbol, if it is bound when the [Let] runs,
   is bound to that constant. Under other environments it may be bound
   to something else, so this is no rewrite under all environments. For
   a unit run on its own it is enough that every static binding of such
   a symbol in the unit binds it to the one constant (for a symbol of
   [known_sets]: to a closure at that slot of that set, or to a block
   of that tag with those fields where they are not variables), which
   is what
   [bound_as] checks; the symbol is then bound to it or to nothing, and
   where it is bound to nothing the defining expression has no value in
   the unit as it was (every operation on a symbol bound to nothing is
   undefined, decision D8). So the unit folded refines the unit, run on
   its own ([fold_known_unit_program_refines_statement]); it is not an
   equivalence, for that last reason.

   Nothing is guessed: the bindings are read off the unit itself. A
   variable that stands for a symbol is not looked through; following
   aliases is another pass (../types/rocq/FlambdaAliasesSpec.v), to be
   run before this one, and again after it for the symbols and constants
   that it puts in place of projections.

   What is not here: what a value slot holds, of a closure one of whose
   value slots holds a variable (a value computed when the unit runs),
   and what a field that is a variable holds; the variable is in scope
   where the symbol is bound and not in code. [Is_int] and [Get_tag] of
   a static block one of whose fields is a variable are not folded
   either.

   The proofs are in FlambdaKnownSymbolsProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
