(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaInlineFreshSpec.v. Nothing here
   needs review.

   The refinement is three steps. The binders of closed code may be
   renamed where the code is bound (FlambdaNominalProofs.
   rename_code_binders), so the call of the code is equivalent to the
   call of the code opened at the fresh variables. The opened code
   meets FlambdaApplySpec.inlinable, its variables being the fresh
   ones ([opened_inlinable]), so its call refines its body inlined
   (FlambdaApplyProofs.inline_let_code). And the code is renamed back
   where it is bound.

   The choice. The result is a run of [Let]s that bind the fresh
   variables, around the body of the code renamed. For two lists of
   fresh variables that have no variable in common, the swap of the
   one with the other fixes the free variables of the first result,
   which are those of the call, and sends it to the second result up to
   the body, where the two renamings of the body of the code agree on
   its free variables and so give alpha-equivalent expressions
   ([alpha_renamings_agree]). Two lists that have variables in common
   are both compared with a third. *)
