(* What the array value leaves as it was.

   An immutable array of values may be a value that a primitive makes
   as the term runs: [Value_immutable_array] (FlambdaValueSpec.v),
   called an array value here. One primitive makes it,
   [Make_immutable_array] (FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.v), and nothing else
   does. A static immutable array is not an array value: it is what a
   symbol is bound to, as it was.

   With the array value two relations between values relate more pairs
   than they did. That of the machine with a heap
   (FlambdaHeapMachineSpec.value_related) does by two rules whose text
   is as it was: [Step_array], through the observation
   FlambdaValueSpec.array_of, which reads an array value; and
   [Step_poison], through FlambdaValueSpec.kind_of_value, whose text is
   as it was too and whose last arm answers [Value] of an array value,
   so that where poison is refined a poison of that kind is refined by
   one. That of the lifting (FlambdaLiftSpec.value_lifted) does by its
   rules [Lifted_array] and [Lifted_to_array]. Statements that were
   proved before the array value
   have one or the other in their conclusions, and some in their
   premises as well. This file says that, of a term that makes no
   array and of memories that hold no array value, those statements
   say what they said.

   This file is to be reviewed: the predicates and every statement.

   - What has no array. [no_array_value] of a value: no array value in
     it, all the way down. Of what a symbol is bound to and of a cell
     of the heap: none in the values that it holds; so the elements of
     a static immutable array hold none. [makes_array] of a term: the
     primitive is somewhere in it, in a handler or in the code that it
     binds included. A state is free of arrays
     ([state_free_of_arrays]) when nothing that it holds has an array
     value (its variables, the environments and the arguments that its
     continuations keep, what its symbols are bound to, its heap) and
     nothing that it may come to run makes one (its expression, the
     handlers that its continuations keep, its code).

   - Invariance. A step keeps a state free of arrays, and what the
     state leaves with holds no array value: for the machine
     ([step_free_of_arrays_statement]) and for the machine with a heap
     ([heap_step_free_of_arrays_statement]). The premise is about the
     whole state and not about its expression alone: a call runs code
     of the static environment, and a continuation a handler that it
     keeps. Underneath is a law of the primitives: one that is not
     [Make_immutable_array] makes no array value out of arguments and
     static data that hold none ([eval_prim_no_array_value_statement],
     and [exec_prim_no_array_value_statement] with a heap). Renaming
     the variables and the continuations of a state neither makes it
     free of arrays nor stops it being so
     ([state_free_of_arrays_renamed_statement]). And the refinement of
     expressions restricted to the closed whole source states that
     are free of arrays (the source expression with its environments
     and its memory) commutes with renaming
     ([heap_expr_refines_free_of_arrays_equivariant_statement]): the
     statement of that for all states (FlambdaHeapEquivarianceSpec.v)
     does not give it, as its premise is about more of them. Nor does
     FlambdaHeapMachineSpec.delete_write_wrong_statement give what it
     gave: it is an existence, of a term whose [Let] cannot be removed
     and, within, of a state that shows it, and either may now have
     arrays. [delete_write_wrong_free_of_arrays_statement] is that
     statement for the refinement so restricted: the term makes no
     array and the state is free of arrays.

   - The observation. Of a value that is not an array value,
     [array_of] answers exactly as it did: for a symbol bound to a
     static array, with its elements, and for nothing else
     ([array_of_no_array_value_statement]). No other observation was
     changed in its text. Those that end with a wildcard answer of an
     array value what the wildcard says: [kind_of_value] answers
     [Value], and the observations of blocks, of closures, of boxed
     numbers, of strings and of partial applications have no answer.

   - The relation of the machine with a heap. Its rules are as they
     were written; the one that reads [array_of] is [Step_array], and
     [Step_poison] reads [kind_of_value].
     Between values that hold no array value, under static
     environments that hold none, a rule relates two values through
     values that hold none ([value_step_no_array_value_statement]).
     Between memories that hold none, a correspondence that is valid
     stays valid when it is cut down to the values that hold none, and
     relates the same such values
     ([value_related_restricted_statement]). So two outcomes that hold
     no array value are related exactly when a correspondence between
     values that hold none relates them
     ([outcome_related_no_array_value_statement]): no value that the
     derivation meets is an array value, [Step_array] is applied to
     symbols bound to static arrays only, and every rule relates what
     it related. No copy of the relation as it was is kept to say
     so: what is stated is that the derivation stays among the values
     that there were.

   - The relation of the lifting. Its rules are as they were written
     but for [Lifted_array] and [Lifted_to_array]. An array value is
     lifted to an array value of its elements lifted, or to a symbol
     bound to an immutable array of its elements lifted, and to
     nothing else ([value_lifted_array_statement]); nothing else is
     lifted to an array value ([value_lifted_to_array_statement]); and
     a value that holds no array value is lifted to values that hold
     none ([value_lifted_no_array_value_statement]; the converse
     fails, as a symbol holds none whatever it is bound to). The rules
     go by the head of the first value and relate its parts, and the
     two rules of the array have an array value for their first
     value: so a derivation from a value that holds no array value
     has neither. That is stated with the rules that have no array
     named ([value_lifted_no_array]: the rules of the relation but
     those two, each as it is, under the same static environment).
     They relate exactly what the relation relates of a first value
     that holds no array value
     ([value_lifted_no_array_exact_statement]). That is of the values
     that hold no array value: it is not said that the relation was
     ever those rules, and it had [Lifted_array] before it had
     [Lifted_to_array]. So of a unit that makes no array,
     FlambdaLiftSpec.lift_simulates_statement gives what it gave: the
     values at its exit hold no array value, and those of the unit
     lifted are those values lifted by the rules that have no array,
     under the static environment of the last state
     ([lift_simulates_no_array_statement]).

     Three statements say less, with no rule named. [Lifted_to_array]
     is the one rule that reads a symbol bound to an immutable array,
     so under a static environment with those bindings left out
     ([without_static_arrays]) it relates nothing
     ([no_array_lifted_to_symbol_statement]). Two values that are
     related, the first of which holds no array value, are related
     under it ([value_lifted_reads_no_static_array_statement]), and so
     are the values at the two exits of a unit that makes no array
     ([lift_simulates_free_of_arrays_statement]). The converse is not
     claimed, and the relation under that environment is not the
     relation without the rule: leaving a binding out may uncover
     another binding of the same symbol.

   Nothing here is a premise of another file. *)
