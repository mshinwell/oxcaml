(* Proofs for FlambdaArmNumbersSpec.v. This file needs no review: what
   is to be reviewed is the statement there.

   [number_in_arms x] changes an argument only where it is the
   variable and the variable holds the number that is put for it, so
   the two runs are in step and pass the same values: a bisimulation,
   in which the term and the result are run under the same variables,
   and a continuation stands in the second run for the closure of the
   handler rewritten. What is known of [x] where an expression is
   holds of the variables that it runs under ([holds]).

   Some closures are not so: that of a continuation whose handler is
   rewritten for the number of the arm that applies it
   (FlambdaGiveScrutineeSpec.arm_fact), when [x] is not that number.
   It is in scope in the [Let_cont]s between its own and the
   [Switch], whose handlers do not mention it, in the [Switch], and
   in the arm that the [Switch] takes; the arm taken has another
   number, so does not apply it. The relation of states has the list
   of such continuations ([dead]), and asks that two continuations be
   related only where the expression may apply them and they are not
   in the list; a closure asks the same of the continuations that its
   handler, or a handler bound with it, mentions
   ([closure_mentions]). The arm taken has its own case
   ([Rel_state_arm]), which asks only of the continuation that it
   applies.

   The proof has the shape of that of FlambdaGiveScrutineeProofs.v,
   whose rewrite goes the other way at one position of one
   continuation. *)
