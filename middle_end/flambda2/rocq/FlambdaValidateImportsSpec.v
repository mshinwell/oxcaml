(* The validation, of a unit that imports symbols.

   This file is to be reviewed: [verdict_holds_from] and
   [verdict_knowing_holds_from], which are extracted and read by the
   test tool of middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/, with what they
   are made of ([holds_from], [lifted_holds_from] and the tests that
   it puts together); [holds_from_imports], the three verdicts that
   are accepted under no condition; the ten statements of the
   validation; and [static_names_free_in_head_statement].

   FlambdaValidateSpec.validate_unit_sound_statement is of the two
   units run from the empty static environment
   (FlambdaUnusedStaticsSpec.program_refines). A unit that mentions a
   symbol of another unit is run from the static environment of its
   imports (FlambdaImportsSpec.imports_statics), and of that run the
   statement says nothing: in the empty environment the symbol is bound
   to nothing.

   [validate_unit_sound_imports_statement] is the same of the unit run
   from its imports (FlambdaImportsSpec.unit_refines), whatever they
   are, for three of the five ways in which a unit is validated: the
   two terms are the same up to bound names; they are once normalised;
   they are once the unused static bindings of the term before are
   removed as well ([holds_from_imports]). Why these three:
   - the normalisations of the two terms, the making of loops, the
     placing of continuations, the tidying of the terms so placed and
     the comparison are refinements or equivalences under all
     environments, so under that of the imports;
   - the removal of unused static bindings is a refinement from any
     environments in which the names removed occur nowhere
     (FlambdaUnusedStaticsSpec.drop_statics_refines_statement), and
     they occur nowhere in the static environment of the imports, which
     has no code and binds each symbol to something that holds no
     value.
   Nothing else is asked of the list of imports. A list may bind a
   symbol which the unit before binds too. A run of the unit before
   that reaches that binding is then undefined (a static binding of a
   name that is bound has no step), and the statement holds of such a
   run for nothing; a binding that is not reached, in a handler that
   is not applied, changes nothing.

   The removal is from the term before only, and that is why it needs
   no condition: removing a binding from the term before can only take
   away a reason for it to be undefined. Removing an unused static
   binding from the term after is the converse, and is not right from
   the imports as it stands: a term after that binds an imported
   symbol, and does not use it, is undefined from the imports, and is
   the same as the term before once the binding is removed. A verdict
   that rests on such a removal is not one of the three. It holds
   under the condition that this asks for: the static environment
   binds none of the names that the groups at the head of the term
   after bind (FlambdaUnusedHeadStaticsSpec.head_free_in, the premise
   of FlambdaUnusedHeadStaticsSpec.drop_head_statics_refines_from_statement).
   [holds_from] is [holds_from_imports] with that verdict taken under
   that test, and [validate_unit_sound_head_from_statement], the same
   of the second asking, and the two at the static environment of the
   imports, are the statements of the section above with [holds_from]
   in the place of [holds_from_imports]. The test is of the term that
   the validation removes the bindings from: the term after,
   normalised and tidied.

   [validate_unit_knowing_sound_imports_statement] is the same of the
   second asking (FlambdaValidateKnowingSpec.validate_unit_knowing),
   which is [validate_unit] of the two terms normalised with what is
   known of their names (the aliases of variables, what symbols are
   bound to, the closures that a [Let] binds): those normalisations
   are under all environments too.

   [validate_unit_sound_from_statement] and
   [validate_unit_knowing_sound_from_statement] are the same two from
   any heap and from any static environment in whose code and in whose
   values the names that the validation removes from the term before
   do not occur (FlambdaUnusedStaticsSpec.statics_free_of; which
   symbols and code ids the environment binds is not looked at). The
   two above are these at the static environment of the imports, which
   holds no code and binds each symbol to something that holds no
   value. They are of a unit run after other units have
   bound code and symbols, as far as the model can say what those are:
   a call of code that the unit does not bind has there the meaning of
   the code that the environment binds. They say nothing of a call
   whose code is not code of the model.

   What it is not of:
   - a unit validated once unused static bindings are removed from the
     head of the term after as well
     ([Same_once_head_statics_removed]), where the static environment
     binds a name that the groups at the head of that term bind: that
     removal is the one of the paragraph above;
   - a unit validated once something is lifted
     ([Same_once_lifted]), run from a static environment in general:
     no statement here is of that verdict from a static environment
     that is not that of the imports. The statements used for it are
     those of the four liftings (FlambdaLiftFromArmsSpec,
     FlambdaLiftFromCodeSpec, FlambdaLiftSpec, FlambdaLiftAroundSpec),
     of the tables that a lifting puts at the head of the unit
     (FlambdaUnusedHeadStaticsSpec.add_head_tables) and of what is
     done to a lifted term (FlambdaKnownSymbolsSpec,
     FlambdaKnownSlotsSpec, FlambdaUnusedSlotsSpec,
     FlambdaHoistCodeSpec, FlambdaHoistStaticsSpec), from the static
     environment of the imports. From the imports that verdict is the
     last section of this file;
   - the machine with a stack of handlers (FlambdaTrapSpec.v). Its
     agreement with this one is stated from any static environment
     that holds no code, of which that of the imports is one
     (FlambdaTrapSpec.stack_agrees_from_statement), for a unit whose
     binders are distinct and that follows the discipline of trap
     actions; no statement here puts the two together.

   [validate_unit_sound_verdict_imports_statement], and the same of
   the second asking, are of every verdict, the one that lifts among
   them, at the static environment of the imports. The law of each
   pass that the validation of a lifted term makes is stated from the
   imports in the file of the pass. Those of the rounds, of the
   removal of value slots, of the code taken first and of the reading
   of value slots that are known ask nothing there. Those of the four
   liftings ask that the imports bind no name that the term lifted
   binds; those of the use of what the unit binds its symbols to and
   of the static bindings taken first ask it of the term that the
   pass is given (FlambdaImportsSpec.static_names_free_in). A unit
   may bind a symbol that is also an import, and the validation is
   not given the imports, so nothing in a verdict says that these
   hold: [lifted_holds_from] computes again the terms that
   [validate_unit] compares and tests each of them where the pass is
   made, with the test of the head of the term after where the
   checks of the removal of bindings from it pass, whether a binding
   goes or not. The law of the tables put at the head of the unit
   (FlambdaUnusedHeadStaticsSpec.add_head_tables, the last step of a
   lifting) asks that the imports bind no name that the groups at the
   head of its result bind: it is tested where a lifting is given a
   table, whether the table is put or not. The tests are sufficient,
   not necessary.
   [verdict_holds_from] is that test for the verdict that lifts and
   [holds_from] for the others; what is stated of it is at the static
   environment of the imports, and of the verdict that the validator
   gives of the same arguments.

   The proofs are in FlambdaValidateImportsProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)

   under all environments. The tests are sufficient, and no
   more is claimed of them: a unit that fails one may be correct from
   its imports. What is stated of this function is the statement

   it at another static environment, nor of arguments of which the
   verdict is another. *)
