(* What is known of a static closure whose binding is in sight is used:
   a value slot is read, and a call is made direct. A normalisation that
   refines.

   This file is to be reviewed: [use_known_closures] and what it is made
   of, which are extracted and run by the validation of
   middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/, and the statements.

   Simplify replaces the projection of a value slot from a closure that
   it knows by what the slot holds
   (simplify/simplify_unary_primitive.ml, [simplify_project_value_slot],
   from the type of the closure). A symbol has the type of the closure
   that it is bound to from its binding on. So where an exported
   function uses a value that is computed when its module runs, the
   function's closure becomes a symbol bound to a closure one of whose
   value slots is the variable of that value, and where the function is
   then inlined, further down the unit, the projection of the slot from
   the symbol becomes the variable. Likewise it makes a call of a
   closure that it knows a direct call of the code of the closure
   (simplify/simplify_apply_expr.ml, [simplify_function_call], from the
   type of the callee): where an exported function is given to another
   and that one is inlined, the call of its argument is a call of a
   symbol.

   ../types/rocq/FlambdaAliasesSpec.follow_aliases does both for a
   variable that a [Let] binds to a closure. [use_known_closures] does
   them for a symbol. It goes through a term keeping, for the symbols
   that the [Let_static]s passed bind to closures, what they are bound
   to ([known_closures]). A [Let] of [Project_value_slot slot (Symbol s)]
   or [Project_value_slot_from project_from slot (Symbol s)], with [s]
   known to be a closure that has the slot and, for the second, that is
   at [project_from], becomes a [Let] of what the slot holds
   ([read_slot_named]); the [Let] stays: its variable is then an alias,
   which [follow_aliases] follows. An indirect call whose callee is
   [Symbol s], with [s] known to be a closure, becomes a direct call of
   the code of that closure ([call_known_closure]); inlining it is
   another pass (FlambdaNormaliseSpec.inline_calls). Nothing else is
   rewritten.

   What a slot holds is a variable, a symbol or a constant of the term
   where the symbol is bound. Going under a binder of a variable, the
   closures that have that variable in a value slot are forgotten
   ([forget_slot_var]): the name stands for something else from there
   on. So nothing is asked of the names of the term. A handler of a
   non-recursive continuation is gone into, with what is known where it
   is defined; the handlers of recursive ones and the bodies of code are
   left as they are. In code no variable of the unit is in scope; what
   the unit binds its symbols to with no variable in it is used there
   by FlambdaKnownSymbolsSpec.fold_known_unit.

   The result refines the term, under all environments
   ([use_known_closures_refines_statement]): a symbol is bound once, so
   once the [Let_static] has run the symbol is bound to that closure,
   whose slot has the value that the variable had, and still has, and
   whose code is the code named, so that the direct call does what the
   indirect one did. The pass commutes with renaming, what it knows
   being renamed with the term ([rename_known_closures], which is to be
   reviewed).

   The proofs are in FlambdaKnownClosuresProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
