(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaNominalSpec.v. Nothing here needs
   review.

   All of them come from one fact ([renamed_equivalent]): a state and its
   renaming, under environments that agree on the free names along the
   renaming, are equivalent. That fact is an instance of the bisimulation
   of FlambdaCompareProofs.v, which relates two states whose expressions
   the comparison accepts: the comparison accepts an expression against
   its renaming, under the maps of names that pair each name with its
   image ([rename_expr_eqb], [variables_map]). At code the map is that of
   the binders of the code alone, and that the code is closed says that
   its body has no other free name. There is no bisimulation here. *)
