(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaUnboxInScopeSpec.v. Nothing here
   needs review.

   What is known of symbols alone, where it holds in the static
   environment, holds in the sense of FlambdaUnboxParamsProofs.v under
   any variables ([symbols_facts_hold]); and what holds in that sense,
   made of symbols alone, holds in the static environment
   ([facts_hold_symbols_bound]). So it holds under a group of static
   bindings by the lemma of that file, and in a static environment that
   extends one where it holds. The two rewrites are then proved as
   FlambdaNormaliseSpec.rewrite_code and
   FlambdaRecHandlersSpec.rewrite_rec_handlers are, by the lemmas of
   FlambdaContextProofs.v for a condition on the static environment
   that its extensions keep. For the code of a group, the condition is
   that of the symbols of the group too: it holds of the static
   environment that the group gives, with the code as it was and with
   the code rewritten. *)
