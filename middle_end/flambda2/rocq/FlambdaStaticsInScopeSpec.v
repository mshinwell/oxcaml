(* Every symbol and every code id that a unit mentions is in scope where
   it is mentioned: row 4 of the table of requests/C0-well-formed.md.

   This file is to be reviewed: [statics_in_scope] against the rule of
   scope of section 3 of that note and against the order in which
   Simplify processes a group of static bindings
   (simplify/simplify_static_const.ml), and [static_names_apart].

   The scope of a static name is not that of a variable, and it is not
   read off the text alone. A unit is a sequence of groups of static
   bindings ([Let_static]), each at toplevel (row 1), and the rule is:
   - a symbol that the unit imports is in scope everywhere;
   - in a group, the symbols that the group binds to closures are in
     scope in every definition of the group. Its other symbols are in
     scope in the definitions that follow them, and in the closures and
     the code of the group. The code ids of the group, bound or declared
     deleted, are in scope in every definition of the group;
   - after a group, all it binds or declares deleted is in scope in the
     body;
   - what the body of a [Let_cont] binds is in scope in its handlers,
     recursive or not, at toplevel or not (see below);
   - the body of code sees what is in scope where the code is bound;
   - a code id that is declared deleted is in scope, and is not code:
     [Bind_deleted_code] binds nothing, and a call of a closure of it
     stays undefined where it is executed.

   The clause for the handlers of a [Let_cont] is right only of a unit
   that passes row 1 and [interface_conts_not_rebound], and the check
   is meant with those two. In such a unit a handler binds something
   static only if the body of its [Let_cont] can do nothing but apply
   its continuation or leave the unit by its exception continuation
   (FlambdaWellFormedSpec.handler_at_toplevel). So the run of the body
   of any [Let_cont] binds all that the body binds, down its spine and
   then in each such handler in turn, before it enters a handler of
   that [Let_cont], which it does by applying its continuation or by
   the return of a call to it. The run may also leave the unit by its
   exception continuation before it has bound all of that: row 1
   allows it, and then no handler of the [Let_cont] is entered. What
   the body binds through [Let]s, [Let_static]s and the bodies of
   [Let_cont]s, in no handler, is bound before the body applies
   anything, whatever the unit; the rest needs the two conditions.
   Without row 1 a branch of the body can go round a handler that
   binds a symbol ([branch_round_binding_reads_unbound_statement]);
   without the other a raise that was to leave the unit can
   ([rebound_unit_exn_reads_unbound_statement]).

   Simplify makes such terms, and this is its own discipline: it
   simplifies the body of a [Let_cont] first, and gives each handler an
   environment with the constants that it has lifted meanwhile
   (simplify/join_points.ml, [compute_handler_env], and
   simplify/simplify_let_cont_expr.ml,
   [simplify_single_recursive_handler]: the constants lifted after the
   fork), whether or not the handler is at toplevel. It places those
   constants in the body, under the last [Let] before a test or in the
   handler of a continuation of the body. So a handler may mention a
   symbol that is bound below it in the text: a closure lifted out of
   an arm of a test, in the handler of a test inside that one; or a
   block that the body builds, in the handler of the continuation that
   the body applies last.

   What mentions a static name: a simple that is a symbol; the code of a
   set of closures, made by a [Let] or statically; the symbols that a
   static set gives its closures; and the code that a direct call names.
   A primitive names none.

   [statics_in_scope] is this as a check, with the symbols that the
   unit imports as an argument. [static_names_apart] is what goes with
   it of row 2: no static binding binds an import, and a code id is not
   both bound and declared deleted, nor declared deleted twice. *)

(* No [Let_cont] of the unit, and no code, binds a continuation with the
   name of the return continuation of the unit or of its exception
   continuation.

   Here the model is stricter than the compiler (decision D32). The
   compiler checks nothing of the sort; its binders are fresh names, so
   no term it builds binds one of the two again.

   Why it is asked. Row 1 reads "the handler runs after the toplevel
   bindings of its body" off names, and row 4 relies on it: a handler
   is at toplevel when its body can only apply its continuation or use
   the exception continuation of the unit
   (FlambdaWellFormedSpec.handler_at_toplevel). If a [Let_cont] of the
   unit binds that name again, a body that uses it does not leave the
   unit: it goes to a handler of the unit, which may go on to an outer
   handler that reads what the handler skipped was to bind. The unit of
   [rebound_unit_exn_reads_unbound_statement] below does so: it passes
   [statics_in_scope] and every condition of [well_formed_unit] but the
   last, and its run reads a symbol that is not bound.

   The last condition of [well_formed_unit], the discipline of trap
   actions (FlambdaWellFormedSpec.traps_well_formed), refuses that
   unit: it refuses a [Let_cont] that binds a name on the stack of the
   handlers installed, and at toplevel the exception continuation of
   the unit is on it. So in a unit that passes [well_formed_unit] no
   [Let_cont] that runs at toplevel should bind that name, and the
   half of this condition for the exception continuation may be more
   than is needed. That is not proved: it goes through the stack of
   handlers, the trap check does not visit a handler that nothing
   applies, and it asks nothing of the names that code binds. Until it
   is, [statics_bound_in_run_statement] takes this condition as a
   premise, and its proof uses the half for the exception continuation
   only. The half for the return continuation is asked so that the two
   continuations of the interface are alike: nothing here reads the
   name of the return continuation. *)

(* The static environment that a unit is run from: it binds the symbols
   that the unit imports and nothing else, and no code; and what it
   binds them to mentions only those symbols.

   The predicate is about static names only; it asks nothing else of
   what the imports are bound to. Ordinary imports that are constants
   are covered, such as the symbols of the predefined exceptions. No
   import that is a closure that can be called is: its code is code of
   another unit, which this environment does not bind, and
   [allocated_statics_among imports []] refuses a closure of any code.
   A unit that imports such closures needs that code in the static
   environment that it is run from, and a statement of what that code
   may mention; that goes with the work on the imports of a unit, and
   is not here. *)

      (fun binding => allocated_statics_among imports [] (snd binding) = true)
      (static_values statics).

(* No state of the run of a well-formed unit, started with its imports
   bound, holds a symbol that is not bound or a closure of code that is
   neither bound nor declared deleted, anywhere; nor does its step look
   one up; and the values that it exits with hold none. *)
Definition statics_bound_in_run_statement : Prop :=
  ∀ (imports : list symbol) (u : unit_interface) (e : expr)

(* Why [interface_conts_not_rebound], or the discipline of trap actions,
   is asked. There is a unit that passes [statics_in_scope],
   [static_names_apart] and every condition of [well_formed_unit] but
   the last, which it fails, and whose run reads a symbol that is not
   bound. So it is not a unit that [well_formed_unit] accepts: the
   statement says what goes wrong when neither of the two is asked. It
   binds the name of its exception continuation again, as an exception
   handler:

     let_cont k_outer = (x = the first field of s; return x) in
     let_cont exn e = (apply k_outer) in
     let_cont k = (let_static s = a block; apply k_outer) in
     raise to exn

   Row 1 lets the handler of [k] bind [s]: the body of its [Let_cont]
   only raises to the name of the exception continuation of the unit.
   The check lets the handler of [k_outer] mention [s], which the body
   of its [Let_cont] binds. The raise goes to the handler bound in the
   unit, which goes to [k_outer], and [s] was never bound. *)

(* Why row 1 is asked with the check. There is a unit that passes
   [statics_in_scope], [static_names_apart],
   [interface_conts_not_rebound] and every condition of
   [well_formed_unit] but the first, which it fails, and whose run reads
   a symbol that is not bound. A handler of it binds a symbol, and the
   body of its [Let_cont] can go round it:

     let v = 1 in
     let_cont k_a = (x = the first field of s; return x) in
     let_cont k_b = (let_static s = a block; apply k_a) in
     switch v | 0 -> apply k_b | 1 -> apply k_a

   The check lets the handler of [k_a] mention [s], which the body of
   its [Let_cont] binds. Row 1 refuses the unit: the handler of [k_b]
   binds a symbol, and the body of its [Let_cont] can also apply
   [k_a]. *)
