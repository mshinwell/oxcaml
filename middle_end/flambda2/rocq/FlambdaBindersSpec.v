(* What each binder of the terms of FlambdaModel.v binds: the free
   variables and the free continuations of a term, and the three
   conditions on binders that a well-formed unit meets.

   This file is to be reviewed: the scopes of the binders against the
   compiler's name abstractions; the free names of what has no binder
   against [Named.free_names], [Static_const_or_code.free_names] and
   [Static_const_group.free_names] (terms/flambda.ml) and
   [Code0.free_names] (terms/code0.ml); and the three checks against
   rows 3, 5 and 6 of the table of well-formedness
   (requests/C0-well-formed.md).

   The compiler has no function that computes the free names of an
   expression: [Flambda.Expr], [Let_expr], [Let_cont_expr],
   [Continuation_handler] and [Function_params_and_body] have no
   [free_names]. A binder there is a name abstraction
   (nominal/name_abstraction.ml) of the names bound and a body, read by
   [pattern_match], and the free names of an abstraction are those of
   its body less the names bound ([Name_abstraction.free_names]).
   Whoever builds a term supplies the free names of its body
   ([free_names_of_body] of [Let_expr.create] and of
   [Function_params_and_body.create], [free_names_of_handler] of
   [Continuation_handler.create]); Simplify accumulates them as it
   rebuilds a term, and code keeps the summary it was created with
   ([Code0.free_names]). The functions here compute what such a summary
   is to be, for the fragment of the terms that the model has.

   The names here are the variables and the continuations: the two
   sorts that a renaming renames. Symbols, code ids, value slots and
   function slots occur in terms too, and the compiler's
   [Name_occurrences.t] records them; they are outside the functions
   here, which are the free names of a term projected on these two
   sorts. (That every symbol and code id mentioned is bound is row 4 of
   well-formedness, not this file's.)

   The binders of the fragment, and where what they bind is in scope:
   - [Let x d body]: [x], in [body]; not in [d];
   - [Handler params handler]: [params], in [handler];
   - [Let_cont_non_recursive k h body]: [k], in [body]; not in [h];
   - [Let_cont_recursive handlers body]: the continuations of
     [handlers], in [body] and in every handler of [handlers];
   - [Code params my_closure return_continuation exn_continuation
     body]: [params] and [my_closure], and the two continuations, in
     [body];
   - [Let_static bindings body]: no variable and no continuation.
   Nothing else in the fragment binds one. In particular [let_closures]
   binds each of its variables by a [Let] of its own. (The compiler's
   code also binds [my_depth] and its regions, and a recursive
   [Let_cont] has parameters that its handlers share; the model has
   neither.)

   The free names are lists, read as sets (FlambdaMapSpec.v): a name may
   be repeated, and only [among] is to be asked of them. The compiler's
   [Name_occurrences.t] also counts occurrences and tells their modes;
   the model has neither.

   The free names of a term include those of the code bound in it: the
   free names of code are those of its body less what the code binds.
   This is the compiler's account of code too: its
   [Function_params_and_body] is a name abstraction of the parameters,
   [my_closure] and the two continuations over the body, and the
   summary that code keeps is to be the free names of that abstraction.
   It is why code can be asked to be closed. The human has ruled that
   code is closed (decision D31): [code_closed] is that, as a check.

   There is one function for each sort of name and each sort of term,
   and nothing else in the model is to compute free names or scope. The
   older ones are to be restated by these and then removed:
   FlambdaWellFormedSpec.free_continuations and
   [handler_free_continuations]; the relations [var_free_in_expr],
   [cont_free_in_expr] and those beside them in FlambdaNominalSpec.v;
   and FlambdaNormaliseSpec.expr_in_scope. None of those looks into
   code. On a term whose code is closed they say the same as the
   functions here (FlambdaFreeNamesSpec.v).

   The three checks are conditions of FlambdaWellFormedSpec.v, which
   takes them as conjuncts of [well_formed_unit]. They are here, and
   not there, because the invariant of a state that goes with them
   (FlambdaScopeSpec.v) is defined from them and is below that file.

   Two of them ask more than the compiler checks: see the comments at
   [binders_distinct] and [code_closed].

   The proofs are in FlambdaBindersProofs.v, which needs no review. *)

   - The continuations of a recursive [Let_cont] are distinct, and there

     ([Bound_continuations.create]).
   - The parameters of a handler are distinct, and so are those of code
     together with [my_closure]. The compiler checks this only when its
     invariant checks are on ([Bound_parameters.create] and
     [check_no_duplicates], [Bound_for_function.create]), and then
     compares whole parameters, so that two parameters with one variable
     and different kinds pass. Discrepancies N1-3 and R2-16.
   - The return and exception continuations of code differ. Nothing in
     the compiler checks it. Discrepancy N1-3.
   A term that breaks one of these is not one the compiler builds: its
   binders are name abstractions, opened at fresh names. The machine

   of two handlers of one continuation counts), and the comparison of
   FlambdaCompareSpec.v then accepts terms that no renaming relates. *)
