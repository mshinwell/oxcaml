(* Continuations that behave alike may stand for each other. Nothing here
   needs review: there is no Spec file, as no reviewed statement is made
   with these definitions; they are a tool of proof.

   FlambdaContextProofs.v lets the handler of a continuation be replaced
   by one that refines it under all continuations. That is too much to
   ask of a rewrite which relies on what the continuations in scope at
   the handler stand for: moving a [Let_cont] into the handler that
   alone uses it is one (FlambdaSinkContsProofs.v). What such a rewrite
   can show is that the two closures, applied to the same values,
   come to the same thing ([applies_alike]): the closures are given, with
   the environments of their definition, so the continuations in scope
   are known.

   [replace_closure_equivalent] says that this is enough: an expression
   behaves alike under two continuation environments that differ in what
   one name is bound to, if the two things apply alike. The proof is
   that of FlambdaContextProofs.transfer, by induction on the length of
   a run that ends: the closures made on the way hold the one
   environment or the other and are otherwise the same ([alike]), and
   where one of the two given is applied the other comes to the same by
   assumption, with no need of the induction. Divergence follows
   (FlambdaSemanticsProofs.equivalent_of_terminating). *)
