(* An arm of a switch that applies a continuation which only applies
   another: a normalisation that is an equivalence.

   This file is to be reviewed: [shortcut_switches] and what it is made
   of, which are extracted and run by the validation of
   middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/, and the statement.

   Simplify does not keep a non-recursive continuation whose handler,
   once rebuilt, is a single [Apply_cont]: it records the continuation
   as a shortcut to the one its handler applies
   (simplify/simplify_let_cont_expr.ml, where the handler of a
   non-recursive continuation is rebuilt: [Shortcut_to], then
   [Upwards_env.add_continuation_shortcut]), and every application of it
   is rebuilt as an application of that one, with the arguments of the
   handler (simplify/continuation_shortcut.ml, [apply]). The back edge
   of a loop is one: the front end ends the body of a [while] or a [for]
   with a continuation of no parameters that applies the loop, and the
   [Switch] of the test has an arm to it.

   [shortcut_switches] does the case of that shape, which is a fact
   about two expressions on their own. Where a [Let_cont] binds a
   continuation of no parameters whose handler is one [Apply_cont], and
   its body is a [Switch], an arm that applies the continuation to no
   arguments becomes the [Apply_cont] of the handler ([shortcut_arm]):
   the handler runs under the variables of the [Let_cont], which are
   those of the [Switch]. The [Apply_cont] of the handler must not be of
   the name being bound, which in the handler is another continuation.
   Simplify makes no shortcut of an exception handler, nor of a handler
   whose [Apply_cont] has a trap action; so neither does this pass, and
   an arm that has a trap action of its own stays as it is. The
   [Let_cont] goes if no arm names its continuation any more
   (FlambdaNormaliseSpec.arms_apply).

   What it leaves: a continuation with parameters, whose shortcut needs
   the arguments put for the parameters; an application that is not an
   arm of the [Switch] directly under the [Let_cont], in another handler
   or under a [Let]. FlambdaSinkContsSpec.sink_let_conts and
   FlambdaNormaliseSpec.inline_tail_conts must come before this pass in
   a round: a continuation that is applied once by the handler of the
   one of no parameters is inlined there by Simplify, which makes no
   shortcut to a continuation it inlines
   (simplify/simplify_apply_cont_expr.ml, the comment in
   [rebuild_apply_cont]).

   Renaming: the functions here compare names by equality only and bind
   none, so the pass commutes with a renaming. That statement is owed to
   the nominal work and is not made here.

   The proofs are in FlambdaShortcutProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
