(* A machine with a stack of exception handlers and of calls, and what the
   discipline of trap actions buys: on a unit that follows it, and whose
   binders are distinct, this machine and the machine of
   FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v behave alike.

   This file is to be reviewed: [stack_entry], [stack_run_call],
   [unwind], [stack_enter], [stack_call], [stack_apply_cont],
   [stack_step], [stack_run],
   [stack_behaves], [initial_stack] and the three statements about the
   two machines, against what the backend does with the terms it is
   given (middle_end/flambda2/to_cmm/to_cmm_expr.ml: translate_raise,
   translate_apply, translate_jump_to_continuation;
   backend/select_utils.ml: combine_traps, set_traps);
   [raises_as_marked] against to_cmm's test of what is a raise
   (to_cmm_expr.ml: apply_cont, let_cont, let_cont_not_inlined;
   to_cmm_env.ml: create, add_exn_handler, is_exn_handler), with its
   two statements; and the action of renamings on a stack
   ([rename_stack_entry]), with its four statements.

   The machine of FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v goes by the names in a term: a
   raise goes to the continuation it names, and an exception of a call
   to the exception continuation the call names; it does not execute
   trap actions. The code that the backend makes goes by a stack. The
   machine here is that reading of a term, written from to_cmm and from
   the selection of instructions; that the backend's code behaves as
   this machine does is not stated here, and nothing here proves it:
   - a [Push] installs a handler: it puts on the stack what the
     continuation it names stands for. A [Pop] removes the entry on
     top, whatever it names;
   - a raise (FlambdaModel.is_raise) removes the entry on top and goes
     to it, whatever continuation the raise names;
   - a call of code with as many arguments as it has parameters
     (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.shape_of_call says what a call is) puts on
     the stack the return continuation of the caller,
     with the extra arguments of the call, and above it a handler that
     stands for the exception continuation of the code called, which is
     how the body of code starts: with one handler installed. The body
     runs with its two continuations bound to nothing, so that applying
     either leaves the body ([Exit]): by the return continuation, the
     call returns to what the stack holds; by the exception
     continuation, the exception is raised again in the caller, with
     the extra arguments of the call after it, to the handler that is
     then on top. The exception continuation that the call names is
     not looked at (To_cmm_expr.translate_apply does not look at it
     either, and wraps the call in a handler that adds the extra
     arguments);
   - a call that makes a partial application puts nothing on the stack:
     the partial application is given to the return continuation of the
     call. A call with more arguments than the code has parameters is
     the call of the code with the first of them, as above, but the
     stack keeps the arguments that remain ([Call_then]); when the body
     returns, its result is called with those, under the stack as it
     was at the call, for the return continuation and with the extra
     arguments of the whole call. So a raise in either of the two calls
     goes to the caller's handler with the extra arguments. That is the
     backend's path for an indirect call of unknown arity: the compiled
     program makes the two calls in one generic application
     (caml_applyN), inside the handler that To_cmm_expr.translate_apply
     wraps it in. The machine reads a direct call and a call of known
     arity in the same way, which the backend does not: it refuses the
     one and compiles the other as a full call (discrepancy C3-9), and
     nothing is said here of what the compiled program does with
     those;
   - a unit starts with one handler installed, which stands for its
     exception continuation, and ends when it applies a continuation it
     does not bind.
   Everything else is the step of FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v.

   Choices, where the backend's code would be in no state that a term
   describes; none matters to a term that follows the discipline:
   - a [Pop] or a raise with no handler on top of the stack is
     undefined, and so is a return with a handler still installed above
     the one the body started with;
   - which [Apply_cont] is a raise is said by the term
     (FlambdaModel.is_raise: it pops the continuation that it applies).
     to_cmm takes an [Apply_cont] for a raise when the continuation it
     applies is an exception handler, and stops if it has no [Pop]
     (discrepancy C5-2). The two agree on a unit whose exception
     handlers are apart from its other continuations
     ([raises_as_marked_statement]).

   [stack_agrees_statement]: a unit whose binders are distinct
   (FlambdaBindersSpec.binders_distinct) and that follows the discipline
   of trap actions (FlambdaWellFormedSpec.traps_well_formed) has the
   same behaviours on the two machines of the model. Both are conditions
   of a well-formed unit. The first is needed: the check of trap
   actions is for such a term, and without it lets through code whose
   return and exception continuations are one name, on which the two
   machines differ ([stack_needs_distinct_binders_statement]).
   [stack_differs_statement]: without the discipline they differ; the
   term is one where a raise names a handler other than the one
   installed last (discrepancy C5-1), and its binders are distinct.

   What the statements do not say. They are about the two machines of
   the model, not about the backend. One part of the step from here to
   the backend's code is made: this machine takes for a raise what the
   term says is one, where to_cmm goes by the mark on the handler
   applied, and in a unit that passes the other check
   (FlambdaWellFormedSpec.unit_exn_handlers_well_formed) the two take
   the same [Apply_cont]s for raises ([raises_as_marked_statement]; not
   without the check, [raises_not_as_marked_statement]). The rest is
   not made: what to_cmm does with a raise, a call or a trap action is
   not modelled.

   This machine commutes with renaming, as the other does
   ([stack_step_equivariant_statement] and the three after it;
   FlambdaEquivarianceSpec.v has the other's). A stack holds names (the
   two continuations of the code of a call in progress) and
   continuation values, and the action renames those.

   The proofs are in FlambdaTrapProofs.v, which needs no review. *)

   - A raise goes to the handler on top. If that stands for nothing, as
     the handler that the body of code starts with does, the raise
     leaves by it.
   - Leaving the unit, which is when no call is in progress, ends
     execution, if at most the handler that it started with is
     installed.
   - Leaving the body of code by its return continuation, with the
     handler it started with on top, returns to the caller.
   - Leaving the body of the first call of an over-application by its
     return continuation, with that handler on top and one value, calls
     the value with the arguments that remain, under the stack below
     the call; a partial application that this makes is given to the
     return continuation of the whole call.
   - Leaving the body by its exception continuation, that handler
     removed, raises in the caller, with the extra arguments of the
     call. *)
(* CR mshinwell: Where the stack is not what a term that follows the
   discipline would have, this machine is undefined: a [Pop] or a raise
   with no handler on top, a return or the end of the unit with a
   handler still installed, the body of code left by a continuation
   that is neither of its two, the first call of an over-application
   that returns other than one value. The code that the backend makes
   would do
   something there that no term describes (a [Pop] removes whatever is
   on top, a raise goes to whatever handler is installed, of whatever
   call), and to_cmm stops on some of these terms when it visits them.
   So undefined is a choice. Nothing proved depends on it:
   [stack_agrees_statement] is about units on which none of this
   happens. Discrepancies C5-1 and C5-2. *)

(* The two machines take an [Apply_cont] for a raise when the term says
   that it is one: it pops the continuation that it applies
   (FlambdaModel.is_raise, the compiler's [Apply_cont_expr.is_raise],
   which is what Simplify goes by). to_cmm goes by the continuation
   applied: an [Apply_cont], alone or as the arm of a [Switch], is a
   raise when that continuation is one of the exception handlers in
   scope (To_cmm_expr.apply_cont, by To_cmm_env.is_exn_handler). Those
   are the exception continuation of the function, or of the unit, that
   is being translated (To_cmm_env.create) and the continuations bound
   since by a non-recursive [Let_cont] whose handler says that it is an
   exception handler, in the body of that [Let_cont]
   (To_cmm_expr.let_cont_not_inlined, by To_cmm_env.add_exn_handler).
   to_cmm stops on a recursive [Let_cont] with such a handler, and never
   takes a name out of the set: the compiler binds a name once.
