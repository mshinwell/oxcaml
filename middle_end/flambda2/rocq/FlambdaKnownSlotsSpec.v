(* A value slot that every set of closures of the unit gives the same
   symbol or constant is that symbol or constant wherever it is read.

   This file is to be reviewed: [slots_made] and [slots_known], which
   say what is known; [slots_as], the check; [read_slots] and
   [read_slot], the rewrite, against the rule of scope of
   FlambdaStaticsInScopeSpec.v; [read_known_slots], which is extracted
   and run by the validation of middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/;
   [read_known_slots_anywhere], the same with every symbol that the
   unit binds taken to be in scope, which the validation runs after
   its last lifting; and the statements, the last six of which are
   the rewrites computed on small units: a slot read, a slot that one
   set gives a variable, a symbol that is not in scope, a projection
   in the code of a stub, a set that the code of a stub makes, and
   the symbol that is not in scope read all the same.

   What Simplify does. It simplifies the code of a function where it
   simplifies the set of closures that the function is of, and gives
   [my_closure], in that code, the type of an alias of the name that
   the closure is bound to there (simplify/simplify_set_of_closures.ml,
   [dacc_inside_function]). That name has the type of the closure,
   whose value slots have the types of what the set puts in them
   (simplify/simplify_set_of_closures_context.ml,
   [compute_closure_types_inside_functions]). So
   where a function that stays a function makes a closure that uses a
   function of the module, or itself, the value slot of the closure
   holds a symbol once those are lifted, and in the code of the closure
   the projection of that slot from [my_closure] becomes the symbol
   (simplify/simplify_unary_primitive.ml, [simplify_project_value_slot]):
   the code calls the symbol.

   That is right of the code as Simplify rewrites it for that one set.
   The code of the model is bound once and may be the code of several
   closures, and nothing in the model says which set a closure that is
   called was made by (FlambdaClosuresSpec.v, "The set that a piece of
   code belongs to"). So what is here does not go by the code. It goes
   by the slot, and asks more than Simplify needs:

   - every set of closures that the unit makes, by a [Let] or
     statically, in code and in handlers too, and that has the value
     slot, gives it the same symbol or constant. That is checked
     ([slots_as]), for what the unit itself is read to make
     ([slots_known] of [slots_made]): nothing is guessed, and nothing
     is believed of what is read. A slot that some set gives a
     variable is never read, whatever the other sets give it: the
     value of a variable is computed when the unit runs.
   - the unit is run on its own, from the empty environments, where
     nothing that it imports is bound. Every closure of its run is
     then made by one of those sets, or is a symbol that the unit
     binds to one, so that a projection of the slot that has
     a value has that symbol or constant for its value, whatever
     closure it is from ([slots_as_kept_statement],
     [read_slot_sound_statement]). Under other environments, or with a
     closure of another unit, this fails: a closure from elsewhere may
     hold another value in a slot of the same name. So this is no
     rewrite under all environments, and the statements are of the
     run from the empty environments
     (FlambdaUnusedStaticsSpec.program_refines).
   - the symbol is in scope where it is put
     (FlambdaStaticsInScopeSpec.statics_in_scope, row 4 of
     requests/C0-well-formed.md). The rewrite goes down the unit with
     the symbols in scope, as that check does, and where the symbol
     that the slot holds is not among them it leaves the projection as
     it is. A unit that passes row 4 passes it once rewritten
     ([read_slots_in_scope_statement]). The symbols that the unit
     imports are not known here and are taken to be out of scope: a
     slot that holds one is not read.

   So the rewrite is the scoped one, and it reads less than Simplify
   does. The unit that shows the difference is
   capture_fun_bound_in_handler_run.ml, in
   middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/ocaml/: the closure of a
   function holds a value that a test chooses when the module runs, so
   its symbol is bound in the handler of that test, and the code of a
   closure that calls the function is bound at the head of the unit,
   where that symbol is not in scope. The projection stays there;
   Simplify, which simplifies that code where the closure is made,
   puts the symbol. [read_known_slots_anywhere], below, reads it, and
   with it the unit is validated.

   [read_slots known syms e] replaces, in the whole of [e], in code and
   in handlers too, the defining expression of a [Let] that is the
   projection of a value slot that [known] lists, from any closure, by
   the symbol or constant listed, where that is in scope. The [Let]
   stays: its variable is then an alias, which other passes follow
   (../types/rocq/FlambdaAliasesSpec.follow_aliases) and remove
   (FlambdaNormaliseSpec.remove_unused_lets). The set of closures keeps
   the slot.

   The code of a stub is left as it is (FlambdaModel.code_is_stub, the
   compiler's [Code.stub]). Unless [-flambda2-simplify-stubs] is
   given, and by default it is not (driver/oxcaml_flags.ml), Simplify
   does not simplify the code of a stub where it simplifies the set of
   closures that the code is of (simplify/simplify_set_of_closures.ml,
   [simplify_function]). It simplifies that code where it is bound
   (simplify/simplify_static_const.ml, by
   [Simplify_set_of_closures.simplify_static_stub_function]), and
   there [my_closure] has an unknown type ([dacc_inside_function], the
   case of no function slot): a projection from it stays a projection.
   The sets of closures that the code of a stub makes are read with
   all the others, for what is known and for the check: a closure that
   a stub makes may reach code that is no stub, which reads its slots.
   Nothing is believed of the flag: leaving a projection where it is
   refines whatever code the flag is set on (discrepancy C3-11).

   The unit rewritten refines the unit, run on its own
   ([read_known_slots_program_refines_statement]). It is not an
   equivalence: a projection that has no value in the unit (from what
   is not a closure, or from a closure that has not got the slot) has
   one once rewritten.

   The same holds from a static environment that binds something
   already, where the code in it makes its sets of closures as what
   is known says and what it binds its symbols to has its value
   slots so ([read_slots_refines_from_statement]). A unit is run so
   from its imports (FlambdaImportsSpec.imports_statics), which are
   no code and no closure:
   [read_known_slots_refines_imports_statement].

   It holds too of the unit followed by something
   ([read_known_slots_refines_observed_statement]): what may follow a
   unit (FlambdaObserversSpec.observers) binds no code and names no
   code id, so it makes no closure, and the closures that it has are
   those that the unit gave it.

   The test of scope is there for row 4 and for nothing else: the
   refinement holds whatever symbols are taken to be in scope. Simplify
   reads the slot also where the code is bound above the symbol in the
   text of the unit, as it binds the new version of the code where the
   set of closures is. [read_known_slots_anywhere] does the same: it
   takes every symbol that the unit binds to be in scope. What it
   gives need not pass row 4, so it is for where nothing that follows
   relies on row 4 of the term without testing it; what tests it may
   then refuse. It refines the unit as [read_known_slots] does
   ([read_known_slots_anywhere_program_refines_statement], and the
   two statements after it).

   What is not here: a slot that holds a variable; a slot that two sets
   give different symbols, where the code that reads it is the code of
   one of them only (Simplify knows that; this file would need the test
   FlambdaClosuresSpec.sets_are for it); the removal of a slot that
   nothing reads any more from a set that is not static
   (FlambdaUnusedSlotsSpec.v removes them from the static ones).

   The proofs are in FlambdaKnownSlotsProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
