(* The removal of unused value slots, of a unit that something follows.

   This file is to be reviewed: the statement.

   FlambdaUnusedSlotsSpec.drop_unused_slots removes value slots from
   the static sets of closures of a unit that projects none of them,
   and is stated of the unit run on its own and from its imports
   (FlambdaUnusedSlotsSpec.v). Here the unit is followed by something:
   the unit and the unit without the slots are run from one
   continuation environment of what may follow a unit
   (FlambdaObserversSpec.observers), from the static environment of the
   imports and the empty heap. What may follow is taken at the slots
   removed: FlambdaObserversSpec.observer asks of a handler that it
   project none of the slots that it is given, so no slot removed is
   read after the unit either. A closure that the unit hands on may be
   a symbol bound to a static set, and what follows may project a slot
   of it that is kept.

   The second run refines the first, with the same exits
   ([drop_unused_slots_refines_observed_statement]): what follows is
   the same term in the two runs, it has no static set of closures to
   remove a slot from, and no value changes, as a value does not hold
   what a symbol is bound to. With no continuation it is
   FlambdaUnusedSlotsSpec.drop_unused_slots_refines_imports_statement.
   The two runs then come to results that differ in nothing that an
   exit is compared by (FlambdaObserversSpec.refines_under_observers,
   at the slots removed): FlambdaUnusedSlotsObservedProofs.v has that
   as a lemma.

   The statement is in a file of its own because
   FlambdaObserversSpec.v says what an observer is with the check of
   FlambdaUnusedSlotsSpec.v ([slots_unused]).

   Whether this is what the verdict on a unit whose value slots are
   removed is to mean has not been decided (FlambdaObserversSpec.v). No
   function of the validation changes.

   The proofs are in FlambdaUnusedSlotsObservedProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
