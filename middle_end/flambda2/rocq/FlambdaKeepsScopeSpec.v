(* The rewrites of the validation keep scope.

   This file is to be reviewed: the statements.

   A rewrite keeps scope (FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceSpec.keeps_scope)
   if, on a term whose code is closed, the code of its result is closed
   and every variable or continuation that is free in the result is free
   in the term; the free variables and continuations are those of the
   one function for each sort of FlambdaBindersSpec.v, which goes into
   code. FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceSpec.v says why it matters: a
   rewrite that makes names commutes with a renaming of the term only up
   to those names, and that is enough for the validation as long as the
   rewrites that follow it keep scope. The statements here say that a
   rewrite of the validation does, one statement to a rewrite: the
   comparison, the pass that gives every binder a name of its own, and
   the rewrites that a round of the validation is made of.

   What is not here: the inlining of the calls of known code, and a
   round as a whole. Their statements are to come with the change that
   makes the validation give every binder a name of its own, which
   changes both. Nor are the rewrites for lifting and for loops here.

   The comparison up to bound names comes first
   ([expr_eqb_keeps_scope_statement]): of two terms that it accepts,
   if the code of the first is closed, the code of the second is, and
   every free variable or continuation of the second is free in the
   first. A normalisation that keeps its candidate only where the
   comparison accepts it (FlambdaRenameApartSpec.rename_apart_avoiding,
   and so FlambdaRenameApartSpec.rename_apart) keeps scope for that
   reason alone.

   Nothing is asked of a term but that its code is closed, which
   [keeps_scope] itself asks. Without it the comparison accepts two
   terms of which the second has a free variable that the first has
   not (FlambdaCompareAlphaSpec.expr_eqb_open_code_statement is such a
   pair).

   Nothing is trusted here. The proofs are in
   FlambdaKeepsScopeProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
