(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaForwardKindedSpec.v. Nothing here
   needs review.

   The relation between a term and its result is that of
   FlambdaForwardProofs.v, taken strict, with the kinds that the pass
   keeps: an application that goes on has arguments that are known to
   have the kinds of the parameters, and its entry is for a handler
   that gives as many kinds as it has parameters. The first run then
   takes its step where the application is: the arguments have values
   of those kinds (FlambdaNormaliseProofs.kinds_hold,
   [have_kinds_sound]), the test of kinds passes
   and the parameters are bound. So the first run is undefined only
   where the second is, the rounds of FlambdaForwardProofs.v are read
   both ways ([fwd_round], [fwd_round_back]), and each term refines
   the other. That holds under any variables that have the kinds the
   pass starts from ([forward_kinded_under_equivalent_bound]).

   In the body of code the pass starts from the kinds of what a call
   binds, and a call binds the variables of
   FlambdaCodeLetsSpec.code_in_scope so
   (FlambdaCodeLetsProofs.code_in_scope_hold). So the new body
   refines the old one where it runs, and the old one the new, and a
   group of static bindings may have the bodies of its code replaced,
   one piece of code at a time
   (FlambdaContextProofs.let_static_code_refines_where), as in
   FlambdaCodeLetsProofs.v. The rest is the induction of
   FlambdaNormaliseProofs.rewrite_code_equivalent. *)
