(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaUnboxParamsSpec.v. Nothing here
   needs review.

   Giving a continuation one more parameter changes its handler and
   every application of it together, so it is proved by a simulation
   ([state_rel]) and not part by part ([One_parameter]). The simulation
   is one in which a step of the second state is answered by one or
   more of the first, or by a refinement that is already known
   ([Ahead]): at an application of the continuation the second run
   enters the handler after, and that this refines the handler before,
   entered with the same values, is asked as a hypothesis, with what
   the value of the new argument must be. The hypothesis holds where
   the handler after is the handler before without a [Let] that reads
   a parameter ([read_refines]): by the lemmas of contexts, down to
   the [Let], which binds its variable to what the new parameter holds
   already. The pass is then that rewrite, for the [Let] that a handler
   begins with, done again and again, each time under the facts that
   hold where its [Let_cont] is. FlambdaUnboxVariantsProofs.v uses the
   same two for a [Let] further down. *)
