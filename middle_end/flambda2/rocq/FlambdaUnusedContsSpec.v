(* Removing continuations that are not used: a normalisation that is an
   equivalence.

   This file is to be reviewed: [remove_unused_conts] and [cont_free_b],
   which are extracted and run by the validation of
   middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/, and the statement.

   Simplify deletes a continuation that nothing applies
   ([Simplify_let_cont_expr]: a handler with no uses is not rebuilt). A
   match whose scrutinee becomes known, by inlining for one, leaves the
   continuations of the arms that are not taken in that state: the
   [Switch] is folded to one arm and the others are applied by nothing.

   [remove_unused_conts] removes a non-recursive [Let_cont] whose
   continuation is not free in its body, once the unused continuations
   of the body have themselves been removed, so that a continuation used
   only by the handler of an unused one goes too. It goes into the
   handlers of the non-recursive continuations that stay; recursive
   [Let_cont]s are kept, their handlers as they are, and the bodies of
   code are not gone into (FlambdaNormaliseSpec.rewrite_code takes the
   pass there).

   [cont_free_b] is the test. It may say that a continuation is free
   when it is not (it does not look at whether a recursive [Let_cont]
   binds the name), never the reverse.

   The result is equivalent to the term
   ([remove_unused_conts_equivalent_statement]), by
   FlambdaNominalSpec.unused_let_cont_statement at each [Let_cont]
   removed, so the pass may be applied on both sides of the comparison.

   The proofs are in FlambdaUnusedContsProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
