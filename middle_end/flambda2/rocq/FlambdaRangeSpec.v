(* What a unit whose numbers are in range gains: no state of its run
   holds a number out of range.

   This file is to be reviewed: [state_in_range] and what it is made of,
   and the statements.

   The check is FlambdaWellFormedSpec.numbers_in_range, a condition on
   the term alone: every tag of a block, every constant and every other
   number of the term is one that the compiler's can be.
   FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.v says which those are (the section "Numbers in
   range") and what it is for a value to be in range
   ([value_in_range]): its constants are in the range of their kind and
   its blocks have tags in range, all the way down.

   A state is in range ([state_in_range]) when everything it holds is:
   the expression left to run; the values of its variables; the handlers
   and the environments that its continuations keep; what its symbols
   are bound to, and its code. A unit that passes the check starts in
   such a state, a step keeps a state so
   ([step_in_range_statement]), and what the run leaves with is in
   range too ([run_in_range_statement],
   [run_exit_in_range_statement]).

   The check is a condition of well-formedness
   (FlambdaWellFormedSpec.well_formed_unit), so every state of the run
   of a well-formed unit is in range
   ([well_formed_in_range_statement]). Two things follow for such a
   state.
   - Every block that a variable holds, made by a primitive or static,
     has a tag that the compiler's blocks can have, and so have the
     blocks in its fields ([blocks_in_range_statement]). The machine
     does not test the tag where a block is made; this is why it need
     not.
   - Every constant of an integer kind that a variable holds is an
     integer of that kind ([integers_in_range_statement]). The
     arithmetic, the comparisons, tagging and untagging have no value
     on a constant out of the range of its kind
     (FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.int_of_value); in such a run that case does
     not arise, for a variable or for a constant written in the term.

   The check looks at no name, so a renaming of the term leaves it as
   it is ([numbers_in_range_renamed_statement]).

   Three units are run, so that the statements are not about units that
   all go wrong, and to show what the check keeps out. One passes, and
   leaves with a block of the greatest tag and an int8 that has wrapped
   ([in_range_runs_statement]). One makes a block with tag 300: the
   check refuses it, and its run leaves with that block
   ([tag_out_of_range_statement]). One adds to the int8 200: the check
   refuses it, and its run goes wrong
   ([constant_out_of_range_statement]).

   The proofs are in FlambdaRangeProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
