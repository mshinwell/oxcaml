(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaLiftObservedSpec.v. Nothing here
   needs review.

   The simulation of each lifting is the one of its own proofs file,
   from the state that the unit starts in with a continuation
   environment of what may follow a unit
   (FlambdaObserversSpec.observers), and without the invariant of the
   first run that the test of the exits gives. What may follow a unit
   has no [Let] to lift and no code, so each rewrite leaves it as it is
   and it is related to itself; it binds nothing static, so the run of
   the unit lifted from it makes no static fault
   (FlambdaUnitFromProofs.well_formed_never_faults_under); and it names
   no code id, so it makes no closure of the code of a function. The
   values of two exits that answer each other are lifted, so they have
   the same constants and the same locations
   (FlambdaLiftProofs.lifted_same_scalars), and the two heaps are the
   same.

   The lifting to a group around needs, of the run of the unit
   rewritten, that it reads no variable that has no value, which is so
   of a unit run on its own and not of what may follow it. Its
   statement is proved from the one about the two exits
   (FlambdaObserversSpec.under_observers_worlds_statement): the two
   units are run on their own to their exits, as in
   FlambdaLiftAroundProofs.v, and what follows is the same term in the
   two runs, with no group put (FlambdaLiftAroundProofs.unit_around_worlds).

   The tables bound at the head after the four liftings: the statement
   of that step is of a term run under continuations in which the
   symbols of the tables do not occur
   (FlambdaUnusedHeadStaticsSpec.add_head_tables_refines_under_statement).
   What may follow a unit names no symbol and no code id and binds
   nothing static, so no set of names occurs in it
   ([observers_free_of]). *)
