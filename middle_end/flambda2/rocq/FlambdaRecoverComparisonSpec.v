(* A test against zero of the result of a three-way comparison becomes
   the comparison of the two operands: a normalisation that refines.

   This file is to be reviewed: [recover_known_comparisons] and what it
   is made of, which are to be extracted and run by the validation of
   middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/ (nothing applies them yet); the
   table [against_zero], against the compiler's; and the statements.

   What the source has. [compare a b < 0], [compare a b = 0], and the
   first test of a [match] on [compare a b], reach Simplify as three
   primitives: [Int_comp kind (Yielding_int_like_compare_functions s)]
   of the two operands, whose result is the naked immediate -1, 0 or 1;
   [Tag_immediate] of that; and a comparison of the tagged result with
   the tagged immediate 0, which is [Int_comp] at the tagged immediates
   yielding a boolean, or [Phys_equal], the form that [=] and [<>] at
   type [int] take (FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.v, at [eval_phys_equal]). The
   kind is that of the integers compared: tagged immediates for [int],
   and the naked numbers for the boxed integers, once they are unboxed.

   What Simplify does. It makes the third primitive a comparison of the
   two operands themselves, at their kind:
   [Simplify_binary_primitive.recover_comparison_primitive]
   (middle_end/flambda2/simplify/simplify_binary_primitive.ml), which
   [simplify_binary_primitive] applies to every binary primitive before
   anything else. That function looks at [Phys_equal] and at [Int_comp]
   on tagged immediates yielding a boolean, where one argument is the
   constant tagged immediate 0 and the other a variable for which the
   environment has a comparison result
   ([Downwards_env.find_comparison_result]). The environment records
   one where a primitive is recorded for common subexpression
   elimination ([Downwards_env.add_cse], with
   [Comparison_result.create] of
   middle_end/flambda2/simplify/comparison_result.ml): for a variable
   bound to a three-way [Int_comp], its kind, its signedness and its
   two arguments; and for a variable bound to [Tag_immediate] of such a
   variable, the same, marked as tagged. The new comparison is given by
   [Comparison_result.convert_result_compared_to_tagged_zero]. A test
   with the zero on the left is taken the other way round ([Lt] for
   [Gt], [Le] for [Ge]) before that table is applied. Once the test no
   longer reads the tagged result, the three-way comparison and its
   tagging go where nothing else uses them.

   [recover_known_comparisons] does the same with what can be read off
   the term. It keeps what FlambdaCseSpec.share_primitives_knowing
   keeps: for a variable bound by a [Let] to a primitive that may be
   shared, that primitive and its arguments ([computed]; [Int_comp] and
   [Tag_immediate] may be shared). It looks through every entry for a
   variable and not at the first only ([first_known]), so that it does
   not rest on there being one entry for each variable. A [Let] of a
   primitive that tests two tagged immediates ([tested]), one being
   the constant 0 and the other
   a variable known to hold [Tag_immediate] of a variable known to hold
   a three-way [Int_comp] ([compared]), becomes a [Let] of the
   comparison that [against_zero] gives, at the kind of the three-way
   comparison and applied to its arguments ([recover_comparison]).
   Nothing else is rewritten, and the [Let]s of the three-way
   comparison and of its tagging stay: the validation has other
   rewrites that remove a [Let] that nothing uses. As in
   FlambdaCseSpec.v, which this file follows: what is known of a
   variable, and what mentions it in an argument, is forgotten under a
   binder of it, so that the operands are what they were where the
   comparison is put; a handler of a non-recursive continuation is
   gone into, with what is known where it is defined; the handlers of
   recursive ones and the bodies of code are left as they are, for the
   validation to take the pass into them as it does the other rewrites
   of a round.

   [against_zero] is the compiler's table, case for case. The test
   [c] is of the tagged result [r] against 0, [r] being -1, 0 or 1 as
   the first operand is less than, equal to or greater than the second
   in the reading [s]:
   - [r = 0] is that the operands are equal, and [r <> 0] that they are
     not;
   - a signed [r < 0], [r > 0], [r <= 0], [r >= 0] is the same
     comparison of the operands in the reading [s];
   - an unsigned [r > 0] is [r <> 0], as no unsigned integer is below
     0, so it is that the operands are not equal; an unsigned [r <= 0]
     is [r = 0], that they are equal;
   - an unsigned [r < 0] is never true and an unsigned [r >= 0] always:
     the compiler leaves those two as they are, and so does this file.

   Why it is sound. Where the test has a value, the variable it reads
   has the value that [Tag_immediate] gave of the result of the
   three-way comparison, so that comparison had a value on the values
   that its arguments still have: two integers of its kind, in range.
   The new comparison has a value on them, and it is the boolean of the
   test by the table. For the two cases of equality, two integers in
   the range of a kind that have the same unsigned reading are the
   same.

   The result refines the term
   ([recover_known_comparisons_refines_statement]). It is not claimed
   to be equivalent to it, though it most likely is; a refinement is
   what the term before Simplify needs.

   The pass commutes with the renamings of FlambdaNominalSpec.v, what
   it knows being renamed with the term
   ([recover_comparisons_knowing_equivariant_statement]): it compares
   variables for equality and makes no name.

   The proofs are in FlambdaRecoverComparisonProofs.v, which needs no
   review. That the pass keeps scope is stated in
   FlambdaRecoverComparisonScopeSpec.v. *)
