(* Simulations in which the first state may take steps that the second
   does not answer. Nothing here needs review: it is a way of proving
   [refines], beside FlambdaSemanticsProofs.simulation_refines, which
   asks that the two states step together, and
   FlambdaSimulationProofs.stuttering_refines, in which the second run
   never takes fewer steps than the first.

   It serves where a rewrite takes steps away: a [Let] at the head of
   a handler that becomes a parameter, or the [Let]s that a rewrite
   put there, seen from the result. The relation has a number, which
   bounds the steps that the first state may still take alone: a step
   of the first is answered by a step of the second, to states related
   at any number, or is not answered, and the states are then related
   at a smaller number. So the first run cannot go on alone for ever,
   and a run of the second that has ended bounds the first. *)
