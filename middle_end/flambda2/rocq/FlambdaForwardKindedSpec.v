(* An application of a continuation whose handler only applies another
   applies that other, where its arguments have the kinds of the
   parameters: a normalisation that is an equivalence.

   This file is to be reviewed: [forward_kinded] and
   [forward_kinded_in_code] with what they are made of, which are
   extracted and run by the validation of
   middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/, and the two statements.

   FlambdaForwardSpec.forward_applications makes an application of a
   non-recursive continuation whose handler is one [Apply_cont] that
   [Apply_cont], with the arguments put for the parameters. It refines
   and is not an equivalence: an application evaluates its arguments,
   tests their kinds against those that the handler gives its
   parameters and binds them (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.apply_cont_value),
   and what is put in its place does none of that. So it is for the
   term before Simplify. FlambdaForwardJumpsSpec.forward_jumps is the
   case of a continuation of no parameters, where there is nothing to
   evaluate, to test or to bind: an equivalence.

   The term after needs the same for a continuation with parameters.
   Simplify leaves applications that go through a continuation whose
   handler, in the model, only applies another, in two cases more
   (the header of FlambdaForwardSpec.v says where it records
   shortcuts).

   Every application of the continuation gives one of its parameters
   the same variable, bound in the body of the [Let_cont]. Simplify
   passes that variable as a parameter of its own and binds the old
   name to it at the head of the handler, which is then not one
   [Apply_cont] when Simplify looks for a shortcut. It is how a loop
   in a function leaves for the return continuation with what it has
   computed. Once the validation has followed that [Let] and removed
   it, the handler is one [Apply_cont].

   Or the handler ends a region. A function whose body has a [try]
   has a region, which the continuation that follows the [try] ends
   before it passes its parameter on:

     let attempt n =
       match (try Some (check n) with _ -> None) with
       | Some v -> v
       | None -> -7

   Simplify keeps the region, which the [try] uses, so the handler of
   that continuation is the two primitives that end the region and
   then an [Apply_cont]. The model has no regions: the conversion
   drops those primitives, and the handler is one [Apply_cont] that
   passes the parameter on, in both terms.

   In both cases the term before has its applications forwarded:
   FlambdaForwardSpec.forward_applications does not look for what
   Simplify left. The term after must have them forwarded too, by an
   equivalence.

   [forward_kinded] forwards an application where the three things
   that the application does cannot fail and cannot be seen:
   - every argument has a value. An argument is a constant, a symbol,
     or a variable that a [Let] or the parameters of a handler bind
     around the application, inside the term;
   - the values have the kinds of the parameters. The machine tests
     the kind of what a [Let] binds against the kind of the [Let], and
     the kinds of what a handler is applied to against the kinds of
     its parameters, and has no step otherwise
     (FlambdaSemanticsSpec.step, [apply_cont_value]); so a variable
     bound by one of them, where it is read under that binder, holds a
     value of the kind that the binder gives. Going down the term the
     pass keeps those kinds (FlambdaNormaliseSpec.kinds_in_scope:
     the most recently bound first, as the variables of the machine
     are; [params_in_scope] for the parameters of a handler), and
     asks that each argument have, by them, the kind that the handler
     gives the parameter it is given to ([have_kinds], with
     FlambdaNormaliseSpec.kind_of_simple_in_scope). A constant has
     its own kind and a symbol the kind [Value];
   - the binding succeeds: the application has as many arguments as
     the handler has parameters, and the handler gives as many kinds
     ([kinded_entry]).
   The application then runs the [Apply_cont] of the handler under the
   variables of the [Let_cont] with the parameters bound, and the
   [Apply_cont] put in its place is that one with the arguments put
   for the parameters (FlambdaForwardSpec.forwarded), whose names mean
   the same where the application is (FlambdaForwardSpec.forwarding
   has checked it).

   What the pass keeps, going down a term: the kinds of the variables
   bound around the point ([G]); for each continuation bound around
   it, the kinds that its handler gives its parameters ([K]); and the
   entries of FlambdaForwardSpec.forward_applications ([F]): for a
   non-recursive continuation whose handler, once done itself, is one
   [Apply_cont], the parameters and that [Apply_cont]. An
   [Apply_cont] and an arm of a [Switch] are treated alike
   ([forward_kinded_apply_cont]). The [Let_cont] stays;
   FlambdaUnusedContsSpec.remove_unused_conts removes it if nothing
   names its continuation any more.

   What stops it:
   - what stops FlambdaForwardSpec.forwarding: the [Apply_cont] of the
     handler names a continuation, or reads a variable, that is bound
     again somewhere in the body of the [Let_cont]; it names the
     continuation being bound; the continuation is an exception
     handler; its parameters are not distinct;
   - a handler that does not give as many kinds as it has parameters:
     it never runs, so an application of it is undefined, and the
     [Apply_cont] put in its place might not be;
   - an argument whose kind the pass does not know: a variable free
     in the term. Nothing is assumed of the environments under which
     the term runs. The parameters of code are free in its body;
     [forward_kinded_in_code] is for them;
   - an argument whose kind is not that of the parameter: the
     application is undefined;
   - a trap action, on the application or on the [Apply_cont] of the
     handler;
   - recursive continuations are not forwarded, and an [Apply] that
     returns to a continuation still does: the results of a call are
     tested where they are returned, and their kinds are not known
     where the call is;
   - the bodies of code are not gone into
     (FlambdaNormaliseSpec.rewrite_code takes the pass there, with
     nothing known of the parameters of the code).

   With no parameters this is FlambdaForwardJumpsSpec.forward_jumps:
   a handler of no parameters that gives no kinds, applied to no
   arguments.

   [forward_kinded_in_code] applies the pass to the body of every
   piece of code that a term binds, wherever the binding is, as
   FlambdaNormaliseSpec.rewrite_code does, started with the kinds of
   the variables that a call binds
   (FlambdaCodeLetsSpec.code_in_scope, whose header says why those
   kinds): [my_closure] at the kind [Value], and the parameters at
   the kinds of the arity of the code, unarized. So an application in
   the body of a function that gives a continuation a parameter of
   the function goes on:

     let or_itself x =
       match (try Some (check x) with _ -> None) with
       | Some v -> v + 1
       | None -> x

   Nothing is kept for the return continuation and the exception
   continuation of the code, which no [Let_cont] binds: an
   application may be forwarded to them, and none of them is
   forwarded. The body of code that binds something static does not
   run at all; the pass does not change whether a body does.

   The tests of [forwarding] are on the syntax and may say that a name
   is bound again when it is not, never the reverse; an application is
   then left that could have gone on.

   Renaming: the functions here compare names by equality only and
   bind none, so the two passes commute with a renaming: that is
   forward_kinded_equivariant_statement and
   forward_kinded_in_code_equivariant_statement of
   FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceSpec.v.

   The proofs are in FlambdaForwardKindedProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
