(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaHeapEquivarianceSpec.v. This file
   needs no review.

   The machine with a heap is that of FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v with the
   heap carried along, and the action leaves the heap alone, so each
   case of a step is the case of FlambdaEquivarianceProofs.v. The one
   new thing is a primitive, which reads the static environment for its
   statically allocated values only ([exec_prim_renamed]). The relation
   on outcomes reads the same and no more ([value_related_code]). *)
