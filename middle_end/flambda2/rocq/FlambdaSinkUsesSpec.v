(* Moving a continuation down past the bindings under it: a
   normalisation that is an equivalence.

   This file is to be reviewed: [sink_conts_to_uses] and [sink_to_use],
   which are extracted and run by the validation of
   middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/, and the statement.

   The comparison of two terms is of their bindings in their order, and
   the two terms of a unit may bind a continuation at different places
   among the [Let]s around it.

   The front end binds the continuation that a call returns to before
   the arguments of the call are computed:

     let_cont k (r) = h in
     let x = d in
     apply f (x) -> k

   Simplify leaves such a term in that order. But where it changes the
   parameter of [k] (the boolean result of a call that an [if] tests is
   untagged; a result that [h] does not use is not passed), the call
   can no longer return to [k]. Simplify makes the call return to a new
   continuation, bound at the call, that applies [k]
   (simplify/simplify_apply_expr.ml rebuilds the call with
   [Expr_builder.rewrite_fixed_arity_apply]; the case [New_wrapper] of
   [Expr_builder.rewrite_fixed_arity_continuation] binds the new
   continuation around the [Apply]):

     let_cont k (u) = h' in
     let x = d in
     let_cont k' (r) = (let u = untag r in cont k (u)) in
     apply f (x) -> k'

   Once [k], applied once, is inlined in [k']
   (FlambdaSinkContsSpec.sink_let_conts, then the inlining of a
   continuation applied at the end of the body of its [Let_cont]), the
   handler is the one the term had before, bound after the [Let] and
   not before it. In that handler, the [Let] of the untagging then
   stands before the bindings of the continuations of the test, where
   the term before has it after them:

     let u = untag r in             let_cont k1 () = .. in
     let_cont k1 () = .. in         let u = untag r in
     switch u | 0 -> k1 () | ..     switch u | 0 -> k1 () | ..

   The same happens at a loop. The continuation that follows an
   expression is bound before what the expression computes first. A
   loop in the expression leaves by a continuation of its own, bound
   at the loop, whose handler applies that one. In the term before,
   the validation makes the loop leave by the outer continuation
   (FlambdaForwardSpec.forward_applications), which stays where it
   was bound. Simplify, where nothing else applies the outer
   continuation, inlines it in the one bound at the loop. The handler
   is then bound before a [Let] in one term and after it in the
   other, and only the handler of the recursive continuation names
   its continuation:

     let_cont k () = h in           let x = d in
     let x = d in                   let_cont k' () = h in
     let_cont rec loop (i) = ..     let_cont rec loop (i) = ..
     in cont loop (0)               in cont loop (0)

   And at a test of which one way does something first. Where a
   function is inlined, the continuation that the call returned to is
   bound before the arguments are computed, and the continuation
   where the two ways of a test in the function meet is bound in its
   body, after them; one applies the other. Of the two the
   validation keeps the second in the term before, and Simplify,
   which goes through a continuation that only applies another, the
   first. An arm of the test and the handler of the continuation of
   the other way both apply it:

     let x = d in                   let_cont k () = h in
     let_cont k () = h in           let x = d in
     let y = p (x) in               let y = p (x) in
     let_cont k1 () = .. k () in    let_cont k1 () = .. k () in
     switch y | 0 -> k () | 1 -> k1 ()
                                    switch y | 0 -> k () | 1 -> k1 ()

   [sink_conts_to_uses] gives the two terms one order: a non-recursive
   [Let_cont] goes down past the bindings under it, as far as it can.
   [sink_to_use k h body] is [Let_cont_non_recursive k h body] with the
   binding of [k] so moved. The binding goes
   - past a [Let] whose variable is not free in the handler [h], which
     would otherwise come to mean that variable;
   - past a [Let_static], with no condition;
   - past a non-recursive [Let_cont] of another name, if [k] is not
     free in the handler of that one and its name is not free in [h].
   It stops above the first thing that it cannot pass: a [Let] or a
   [Let_cont] that does not meet these conditions, a [Let_cont] of
   recursive continuations, or the [Apply], the [Apply_cont], the
   [Switch] or the [Invalid] that the bindings end with. So the
   binding of the continuation that a call returns to stands directly
   above the call, where only bindings that it can pass are between
   the two; that of a continuation that an arm of a test names,
   directly above the test or above the continuations of the other
   arms that apply it; that of the way out of a loop, directly above
   the loop. Each of the three moves is one of
   FlambdaSinkContsSpec.sink_into_handler; this pass does not move a
   binding into a handler, nor past a [Let_cont] of recursive
   continuations.

   The tests of freedom are FlambdaNormaliseSpec.var_free_in_handler_b
   and FlambdaUnusedContsSpec.cont_free_b, which may say that a name is
   free when it is not, never the reverse; so the pass may stop a
   binding higher than it need, and never moves one wrongly.

   A move takes the handler with its binding, as it is, and the pass
   removes nothing: it is an equivalence. Going down a term, the pass
   also places the bindings that are inside the handlers of
   non-recursive continuations; the parameters of a handler, their
   kinds and the rest of its metadata are never changed. It does not
   go into the handlers of recursive continuations nor into the
   bodies of code (FlambdaRecHandlersSpec.rewrite_rec_handlers and
   FlambdaNormaliseSpec.rewrite_code take it there).

   It is for the two terms that are compared, once, when the rounds of
   their normalisation are over (FlambdaValidateSpec.placed). In a
   round it would change where a continuation is bound for the
   rewrites of the next round that look at that
   (FlambdaParamAliasesSpec.bind_aliased_params, the inlining of a call
   whose continuation was moved), which follow Simplify on the term as
   it was.

   Renaming: [sink_conts_to_uses] compares names by equality only and
   binds none, so it commutes with a renaming
   (FlambdaValidatorEquivarianceProofs.v).

   The proofs are in FlambdaSinkUsesProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
