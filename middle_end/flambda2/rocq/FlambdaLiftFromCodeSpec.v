(* Lifting out of the code of a function: a [Let], in the body of code,
   of a closure, an immutable block, a boxed number or an immutable
   array whose parts are symbols and constants, made a static binding
   of a symbol beside the code.

   This file is to be reviewed: [closed_named], [lifted_out],
   [lift_from_code], [lifted_out_bindings] and [once_each], against
   what Simplify does (below); [lift_from_code_unit], which is
   extracted and run by
   the validation of middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/; and the
   statements.

   What Simplify does. The conditions under which it lifts a [Let] do
   not ask that the [Let] is at the toplevel of the unit
   (FlambdaLiftSpec.v has them): a set of closures each of whose value
   slots is a constant or a symbol, and a block, a boxed number or an
   immutable array whose type can be rebuilt as a static constant with
   symbols and constants for its parts, are lifted out of the body of a
   function too. The binding of the symbol is then placed at toplevel,
   around the code: a function that needs nothing from around it, given
   inside another function to a third (the function given to a map over
   a list), is the common case. FlambdaLiftSpec.lift_expr makes a [Let]
   a static binding where it stands, which cannot be done in code: the
   machine has no step for a call of code that binds something static.

   What is here. In the body of the code that the guess names,
   [lift_from_code] makes the [Let]s at the paths given aliases of
   symbols, and binds the symbols in the group of static bindings that
   binds the code, before the code:

     Let_static [...; Bind_code id (Code ... (Let x = d in body)); ...]
       becomes
     Let_static
       [...; bindings; Bind_code id (Code ... (Let x = Symbol s in body));
        ...]

   where FlambdaLiftSpec.lift_named gives [bindings] and [s] for [d],
   as for a [Let] lifted where it stands, and [d] mentions no variable
   ([closed_named]), so that the bindings mean the same at toplevel. As
   there, the variable stays, bound to the symbol, for other passes to
   follow and remove; a [Let] is named by its path in the body of its
   code; and which [Let]s, to which symbols, is a guess of the
   caller's, of which nothing is believed.

   The handlers of recursive continuations are gone into: a [Let] that
   mentions no variable makes the same thing each time round a loop,
   and Simplify lifts it from there as from anywhere else (a local
   recursive function that captures nothing, made in the loop of a
   function, is the common case). The path of such a [Let] is under
   that of its handler (FlambdaLiftSpec.rec_handlers_map).

   Two [Let]s may be given one symbol. Where inlining has made two
   [Let]s of one closure that captures nothing, Simplify has one
   symbol for both. The bindings that stand for the [Let]s lifted out
   of one body are put once each ([once_each]): a binding is left out
   if one before it binds the same symbol to the same constant. The
   same constant is the same term (FlambdaModel.static_const_eq_dec);
   the constants compared mention no variable, so the same term is
   the same thing wherever it is evaluated. If a guess gives one
   symbol to two [Let]s that do not make the same constant, both
   bindings stay, the symbol is bound twice, the result is not a
   well-formed unit, and [lift_from_code_unit] gives nothing: the
   guess is refused and the unit stays as it is. Nothing is shared
   between the bodies of two pieces of code, or between code and the
   term outside it: a guess that gives one symbol to [Let]s of two
   bodies is refused in the same way.

   What is shared has no identity. FlambdaLiftSpec.lift_named lifts a
   closure, a boxed number, a block made by [Make_block], which is the
   immutable one, and an array made by [Make_immutable_array]
   (FlambdaLiftSpec.v, "Identity"). A block or an array that a unit
   allocates with an identity is made by a primitive of the heap
   (FlambdaPrimitiveModel.heap_primitive: a block that is mutable or
   unique, a mutable array). [lift_named] lifts none of those, so two
   [Let]s of one are given no symbol, one or two; and the step of
   FlambdaSemanticsSpec.v, which the statements here are about, gives
   such a primitive no value: it is the machine of
   FlambdaHeapMachineSpec.v that executes one. A [Let] that is lifted
   out mentions no variable, so what is put once holds symbols and
   constants only. A location of the heap is a value that only a
   variable holds, so the constant holds none itself: a closure or a
   block that is put once may lead, through a symbol, to something that
   can be written, and is not that thing.

   A [Let] whose parts are variables bound to symbols by an earlier
   lifting is closed once those aliases are followed: the validator
   makes several liftings in turn, each followed by its normalisation
   (FlambdaValidateSpec.lifted_in_turn).

   Why it is right. The first run makes a closure, a block, a boxed
   number or an array each time the [Let] is executed; the second has
   the symbol, bound once, when the group of the code is, to the same
   thing: the parts are symbols and constants, which are the same values
   whenever they are evaluated. The two values are related by
   FlambdaLiftSpec.value_lifted, as for the lifting at toplevel, and no
   primitive and no rule of the machine tells them apart. They differ at
   an exit of the unit, so [lift_from_code_unit] makes the same check as
   FlambdaLiftSpec.lift_unit (FlambdaLiftSpec.exits_plain: the unit
   gives only symbols and constants to the continuations that it may
   leave through). It also checks that the result is a well-formed unit:
   the symbols given are then new and distinct, and the group of the
   code is executed once. With both, the unit lifted refines the unit,
   run on its own ([lift_from_code_unit_program_refines_statement]).

   The second run binds the symbol when the group of the code is
   bound, whether or not the code is ever called. That binding cannot
   itself be undefined under the checks: its fields or value slots are
   constants and symbols, which have values without the symbols being
   resolved (and for a closure of a set, FlambdaLiftSpec.lift_named
   gives bindings only at function slots that the set has); and the
   result being a well-formed unit, the symbol is not bound already and
   the group is not executed again. So code that is never called
   brings no undefinedness to the unit lifted. Where the code is called
   and its [Let] is undefined in the first run (a block one of whose
   fields is a symbol bound to nothing: decision D8), the refinement
   asks nothing more of the second run.

   Two [Let]s with one symbol add nothing to this: both are aliases
   of a symbol that is bound, once, to what each of them makes.

   What is not here: lifting out of the arm of a test at toplevel
   (FlambdaLiftFromArmsSpec.v, which uses the functions of this file);
   a constant with a variable in it; and the sharing of a constant
   with one that the unit binds already.

   The proofs are in FlambdaLiftFromCodeProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)
