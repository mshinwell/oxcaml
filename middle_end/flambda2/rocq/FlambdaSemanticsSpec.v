(* Execution of the terms of FlambdaModel.v, and what it means for two
   terms to behave alike.

   This file is to be reviewed: [closure_of], [closure_in_set],
   [project_value_slot], [project_function_slot], [eval_named],
   [eval_static_bindings], [call_code], [shape_of_closure_call],
   [shape_of_call], [run_call], [apply_cont_value], [with_extra_args],
   [call_function] and the rules of [step], then [behaves],
   [equivalent] and [refines]. The values, the static
   environment and the reading of allocated values are in
   FlambdaValueSpec.v, and what the primitives compute is in
   FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.v; this file exports both.

   The semantics is an abstract machine. A state is an expression with an
   environment giving values to variables, one giving closures to
   continuations, and the static environment; [step] is a function, so
   execution is deterministic by construction. A continuation closure keeps
   the environments of its definition, so no substitution is involved and
   binders may shadow.

   The static environment is what [Let_static] has bound so far: the code
   of code ids, and the values that symbols point to. It is global: it is
   not kept in closures, and only grows. A symbol is a value by itself, a
   pointer ([Value_symbol]), whether or not it is bound; what it points to
   is looked up where it is used, as a closure to call or to project
   from. So a group of bindings may be recursive, and static data cyclic.
   A [Let_static] is executed where it stands; nothing lifts it.

   Flambda permits a [Let_static] at the toplevel of a compilation unit
   only: FlambdaWellFormedSpec.v has the condition. The machine keeps
   static bindings out of the two places where one could be executed more
   than once: calling code whose body binds something static is
   undefined, and so is a [Let_cont_recursive] one of whose handlers does
   ([binds_statics]). It also makes undefined binding a code id or a
   symbol that is bound already. So what a name is bound to never changes
   in a run, and what is known of the static environment where a handler
   is defined still holds where it runs. The rest of the condition, that
   the handler of a non-recursive continuation with static bindings
   postdominates its body, is not the machine's to check.

   A continuation with no binding stands for a way out of the term: the
   return or exception continuation of the enclosing unit. Applying one
   ends execution, and the continuation and its arguments are what is
   observed ([Exit]). This is the only observation so far; there is no
   mutable memory and there are no effects.

   A function call ([call_function]) runs the body of the code of the
   closure called, with the code's return and exception continuations
   standing for the caller's. There is no stack.

   A call need not give a function as many arguments as its code has
   parameters: it is the generic application of the compiler
   ([shape_of_call] says what a call is). With fewer arguments it makes
   a partial application, a value of its own that keeps the closure and
   the arguments so far ([Value_partial_application]), and gives it to
   the return continuation of the call; an indirect call of that value
   with more arguments is the call of the closure with all of them. With
   more arguments it is a full call with the first of them, whose result
   is then called with the rest: the full call returns to what is left
   of the application ([Over_application]), which is a continuation that
   no term names. A partial application is not a closure: nothing can be
   projected from it, and a direct call of it is undefined. The compiler
   has no such value: Simplify turns the partial application of a
   function it knows into a closure of new code, and at run time one of
   a function it does not know is a closure of [caml_curryN]. The
   machine cannot make code, and its one value stands for both.

   Exceptions. An exception handler is a continuation; a raise is an
   [Apply_cont] of it, the exception being the first argument; and a call
   names the continuation that its exceptions go to, with extra
   arguments, which the call evaluates: the callee raises to the caller's
   handler applied to the exception followed by them ([with_extra_args]).
   The two calls that an over-application makes, the full call and the
   call of its result, raise to that one continuation with those extra
   arguments.
   So where an exception goes is said by the term, as for any
   continuation, and the machine has no stack of handlers: a trap action
   ([Push], [Pop]) is not executed. The code that the backend makes does
   have such a stack and goes by it, not by the names. The front end
   builds terms in which the two cannot differ: a raise, and a call
   that raises, names the handler installed last.
   FlambdaWellFormedSpec.v has that discipline as a check of a term
   ([traps_well_formed]). FlambdaTrapSpec.v has a second machine, which
   goes by a stack of handlers as the backend's code does, and the
   statement that the two machines of the model behave alike on a unit
   that passes the check and whose binders are distinct. That the
   backend's code behaves as that second machine is not stated, and
   nothing proves it. There are no backtraces, so the kind of a raise
   changes nothing. The exception is any value: nothing here says what
   an exception is made of.

   A set of closures has functions, each the code of a function slot, and
   value slots, which the functions share. Each closure of the set is a
   value of its own: the set and the function slot the closure is at
   ([Value_closure_of_set]). The closures of one set differ in that slot
   only; a closure does not hold the others. Calling a closure runs the
   code of its slot with [my_closure] bound to that closure, so the
   functions of a set have each their own [my_closure], and reach one
   another by projecting a function slot from it
   ([project_function_slot]): that is how a set is recursive, and no value
   is cyclic. The closures of a static set are symbols, each bound to its
   closure with the symbols of the others ([Static_closure_of_set]);
   projecting a function slot from a symbol gives the symbol of that
   slot. A closure has no identity: two sets made alike are equal.

   The closures of a set of one function whose function slot is not named
   ([Value_closure], [Static_closure]) are those of the fragment before
   function slots. They are read as the closure at
   [unnamed_function_slot] of a set with that one function.

   These definitions can express sets of closures that the compiler does
   not make. In a set the compiler makes, every closure is at a function
   slot of the set, no function slot and no value slot is given twice,
   the functions have each their own code, and the symbols of a static
   set are bound together, each to the closure at its slot. What the
   machine does with the other sets is a choice, not a model of the
   compiler:
   - a closure at a function slot that is not among those of its set is
     not made: making one is undefined
     ([closure_of_set_made_statement],
     [static_closure_of_set_made_statement]). A value of that shape may
     still be in an environment given to a statement; it is not a closure
     ([closure_in_set]), so calling it or projecting from it is undefined;
   - where a function slot or a value slot is given twice, the first of
     the two is the one found, as everywhere in FlambdaMapSpec.v. The
     second is not removed: every value slot is evaluated where the set
     is made, so a second one that has no value makes that undefined,
     and the closure holds both lists as they were given;
   - a set in which two function slots have the same code is made, and
     each of its closures runs that code; so are two static sets of one
     group that have the same code;
   - a closure of code that is not bound is made, and calling it is
     undefined, as for the closures of the fragment before;
   - nothing checks that the symbols a static closure names as those of
     the closures of its set are bound to them. A projection from it
     gives the symbol named, bound or not, as a symbol is a value whether
     or not it is bound. FlambdaClosuresSpec.v says what holds of a set
     whose symbols are bound as [bind_closures] binds them
     ([static_set_bound]).
   A unit that makes only sets such as the compiler's is well-formed
   (FlambdaWellFormedSpec.sets_well_formed, a check, which does not look
   at value slots). The statements of this file are about every term and
   every environment, those that no well-formed unit reaches included;
   FlambdaClosuresSpec.v says what more holds of the run of a
   well-formed unit.

   Execution is undefined ([Undefined]) at [Invalid], at an unbound variable,
   at a continuation applied to the wrong number of arguments, at a
   function called with as many arguments as it has parameters at
   arities that are not those of its code, or with fewer or more
   arguments at arities that the compiler does not take for a partial
   application or an over-application, or with arguments that are not
   of the kinds of the call's arity, at a call of a partial application
   that is direct or gives it no argument,
   at a [Let] whose defining expression has a value of another kind than
   the [Let] gives its variable, at a handler applied to values of other
   kinds than it gives its parameters,
   at a [Switch] whose scrutinee is not a naked immediate with
   an arm, where a primitive has no value, at a call of what is not a
   closure, of a closure whose code is not bound, or directly of a closure
   of other code than the one named, at the projection of a value slot
   from what is not a closure with that slot, at the projection of a
   value slot or of a function slot that names the function slot it
   projects from, from what is not a closure at that function slot of a
   set with the slot asked for, and where a closure is made, by a [Let] or
   statically, at a function slot that is not among those of its set.
   A transformation may do anything to a term whose
   execution is undefined: that is [refines], the statement of correctness
   to use for a transformation; [equivalent] is the stronger, symmetric one.
   [refines_defined_statement] and [refines_antisymmetric_statement] say how
   the two are related.

   Kinds. The kinds and arities that terms carry (FlambdaModel.v) are
   tested where a variable is bound, and nowhere else. A call
   ([call_function]) is undefined unless it agrees with the code called,
   in the three ways given at [call_code] for a full call and in those
   given at [shape_of_closure_call] for the others. Simplify assumes
   each of them, and a well-typed program whose types are refined by a
   GADT can break the second and the third in a branch that is never
   run. A [Let] is
   undefined unless the value of its defining expression is of its kind
   ([step]), and the application of a handler unless the values are of
   the kinds of its parameters ([apply_cont_value]). So, in every run, a
   variable is bound only to a value of the kind that its binder gives
   (FlambdaWellKindedSpec.v has the statements). The CR at [step] says
   why the last two are less certain than the first.

   The primitives are those of FlambdaPrimitiveModel.v, and
   [FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.eval_prim] says what each computes. A law of a
   primitive (say, that an addition commutes) is a lemma about it.

   The lemmas and the proofs are in FlambdaSemanticsProofs.v, which needs no
   review. *)

(* A full call of a closure of the code [c] runs the body of the code.
   The only variables are the parameters, bound to the arguments, and
   [my_closure], bound to the closure; the only continuations are the
   return and exception continuations of the code, which stand for what
   the caller's stand for. So there is no stack: to return is to apply
   the continuation the caller gave. The body must bind nothing static:
   it would do so at each call.

   The call must agree with the code, in three ways. Simplify assumes
   each: it replaces by [Invalid] a call that fails one
   (simplify/simplify_apply_expr.ml).
   - The values of the arguments are of the kinds that the call's own
     arity gives, unarized ([simplify_apply_shared], which compares the
     kinds of the arguments with [Flambda_arity.unarize] of
     [Apply.args_arity]; the reason is
     [Application_argument_kind_mismatch]). The machine looks at the
     kind of a value here, at a [Let] and where a handler is applied
     ([step], [apply_cont_value]). A poison constant has the kind it
     carries, and an allocated value or a symbol, bound or not, has kind
     [Value]: so poison of the right kind passes, and that is
     intended.
   - The arity of the arguments is that of the parameters of the code,
     each parameter unarized ([arity_mismatch], on
     [Flambda_arity.unarize_per_parameter];
     [Direct_application_parameter_kind_mismatch]). One parameter that
     is an unboxed pair is not two parameters; how products are nested
     inside one parameter does not count.
   - The arity of the results that the call expects is that of the
     results of the code, unboxed products and all
     ([simplify_direct_function_call], by

(* What the call of a closure is; [None] where it is undefined. A direct

   A call is the generic application of the compiler, which tells the
   three shapes apart by the number of arguments, counted by parameter
   and not unarized ([simplify_direct_function_call]; at run time, for a
   call of unknown arity, [caml_applyN]). With as many arguments as the
   code has parameters it is a full call, and [call_code] makes the
   three tests. Otherwise the arguments must be of the kinds of the
   arity that the call is made at, and the arities must pass the test by
   which the compiler takes the call for a partial application or an
   over-application (FlambdaModel.partial_or_over_application).
   - With more arguments than parameters it is a full call with the
     first of them, at the result arity of the code, which is one
     [Value]; the result is then called with the rest.
   - With fewer, but not none, it is a partial application of the
     closure to the arguments, and nothing is called.
   What is not tested: at a partial application, nothing is compared
   with the result arity of the code; at an over-application, nothing
   with the return arity of the call, until the result is called. A call
   with no argument of code that has parameters is undefined: the
   compiler stops on one. *)

(* CR mshinwell: two calls are undefined in [shape_of_closure_call] on
   trust.
   - A call of a closure whose code is not bound, or is deleted (no code
     is found), while the closure itself is made, by every form of
     closure. It cannot be undefined where the closure is made, as a
     group may bind a symbol to a closure before it binds the code. It
     is right if code is deleted only when it is never called, which
     nothing checks; for the term after Simplify it is the safe side. It
     is not decided whether well-formedness is to ask that the code of
     every closure is bound by the time it is called, as it is to ask of
     the symbols a term mentions (decision D8). Decision D20.
   - A direct call of a closure of other code than the one named. The
     backend would run the code named, with that closure. Not certain
     where the two code ids are versions of one function: the compiler
     relates them by its code age relation, which the model has not got.
     Discrepancy C0-1; no decision yet. *)

(* CR mshinwell: a direct call, and an indirect call that the compiler
   has marked as of known arity
   ([Call_kind.Function_call.Indirect_known_arity]; the [Indirect] of
   this fragment is both sorts of indirect call), are generic
   applications here: with fewer or more arguments than the code has
   parameters they are partial applications and over-applications. That
   is how Simplify reads a call of any kind once it knows the callee
   ([simplify_function_call] sends all three to
   [simplify_direct_function_call]), and it is what makes an indirect
   call of a known closure the same as a direct call of its code
   whatever the number of arguments
   (FlambdaApplySpec.apply_indirect_known_statement). The backend reads
   the two as full calls: it stops on a direct call that has not as many
   arguments as the code has parameters (to_cmm/to_cmm_expr.ml, "Wrong
   arity for direct call"), and it compiles a call of known arity as a
   full call with no test of the callee. So the machine gives a meaning
   to calls that the backend refuses or would compile wrongly. No term
   that the compiler makes is known to have one: closure conversion
   makes a call direct only where it is full
   (from_lambda/closure_conversion.ml, [close_apply]), and Simplify
   marks a call as of known arity only where its types say that every
   code the callee may have has the arity of the call; nothing checks
   either afterwards. Whether such a call should be undefined, or ruled
   out by well-formedness where the code is named, is not decided.

(* What a call is. An indirect call of a partial application is the

   already, followed by those of the call, of which there must be one at
   least: the compiler makes a partial application a closure of code
   with the parameters that are left, and stops on a call of it with no
   argument. The arguments of the call must be of the kinds of the arity
   that the call is made at, and that is tested here, of the call's own
   arguments, as Simplify tests it of every call before it goes by the
   code of the callee ([simplify_apply_shared]; where the kinds
   disagree, [Application_argument_kind_mismatch]). The call of the
   closure tests the arguments kept and the new ones together, and in
   that test a partial application that no call made, one that keeps
   arguments that are not of the kinds of the arity it keeps, could
   hide a mismatch. A direct call of a partial application is
   undefined: it is a closure of no code of the term. *)

(* A state holds values in its variables, in the environments that its
   continuations keep, and in its static environment. [P] is asked of
   the values of the first two and [Q] of what each symbol is bound to;
   what is to hold of the values inside a statically allocated value is
   for [Q] to say. Both may depend on the static environment of the
   state. The arguments of an exit are not in a state: the statement
   covers them. *)

    : Prop :=
  env_values_all (P (state_statics s)) (state_vars s)
  ∧ conts_values_all (P (state_statics s)) (state_conts s)
  ∧ Forall (fun binding => Q (state_statics s) (snd binding))
      (static_values (state_statics s)).

(* A step keeps it, and the arguments of an exit satisfy [P], given of
   the state at hand:
   - at a [Let], [P] of the value of the defining expression;
   - at a [Let_static] whose bindings evaluate, that [P] is kept by the
     static environment that results, and [Q] of everything bound in it;
   - at an [Apply] and at an [Apply_cont], [P] of the values of the
     simples that the step reads and passes on: the callee, the
     arguments, and the extra arguments of the exception continuation
     of a call, which the continuation given to the callee keeps. The
     value of a variable satisfies [P] already; this is for the
     constants and the symbols among them, of which [P] need not hold
     in general (a symbol that is not bound).
   What a call or the application of a continuation binds are those
   values, so nothing more is asked for them. A call may also make a
   partial application out of its callee and its arguments, or call one
   that an argument or a continuation holds: so [P] of a partial
   application is to be [P] of the value it calls and of its
   arguments. *)
