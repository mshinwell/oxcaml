(* The primitives of Flambda 2 as the semantics sees them: a fragment.

   This file is to be reviewed, against
   middle_end/flambda2/terms/flambda_primitive.mli. It holds definitions
   only: the types of the primitives without their arguments. What each
   computes is FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.v.

   The fragment has, with the compiler's names:
   - of [unary_primitive]: [Block_load] from an immutable block of
     values, whatever the load says of mutability, [Is_int], [Is_null],
     [Get_tag], [Array_length] of an array of values, [String_length] of
     a string, [Opaque_identity], the
     unary [Int_arith] (here [Unary_int_arith]), [Num_conv] between the
     integer kinds, [Boolean_not], [Unbox_number],
     [Box_number], [Untag_immediate], [Tag_immediate] and
     [Reinterpret_64_bit_word] between a tagged immediate and an int64;
   - of [binary_primitive]: [Array_load] from an array of values,
     [String_or_bigstring_load] of an integer of one, two, four or
     eight bytes from a string, [Phys_equal], and [Int_arith],
     [Int_shift] and [Int_comp], at every [Standard_int.t];
   - of [variadic_primitive]: [Make_block] of an immutable block of
     values;
   - under [Heap], with the primitives of C4's prototype: [Make_array]
     of a mutable array of values (here [Make_mutable_array]), and the
     ternary [Array_set] into one.
   Every other primitive is left out. The conversion from the compiler's
   terms must refuse a primitive that is not here, and a primitive whose
   fields have a value that is not here; it must never approximate one.

   Differences from the compiler:
   - [Opaque_identity] has no [middle_end_only], which has no effect on
     execution.
   - [Box_number] and [Make_block] have no allocation mode: they are the
     allocations on the heap, and the conversion must refuse a local one.
   - [Make_block] has no mutability: it is that of immutable blocks
     ([Immutable], not [Immutable_unique]), and the conversion must
     refuse the others. So every block of the model is immutable.
     [Block_load] has the mutability of the compiler's, and is a load
     from such a block whatever that is: the front end marks [Mutable]
     a load that the source declares as one of a field that may be
     written ([Reads_vary]: [%field0] and [%field1], and the [!] of a
     reference), and nothing stops a source from declaring such a load
     of a tuple.
     The only [Block_access_kind.t] and [Block_kind.t] are those of
     blocks of values, [Values]; an [Or_unknown.t] is an [option],
     [Unknown] being [None].
   - [Block_kind.Values] has no list of the kinds of the fields. In the
     compiler each has a subkind, which Simplify takes an argument that
     is a variable to be of ([Simplify_variadic_primitive]). The model
     has no subkinds, so the conversion must refuse a list that says
     more of a field than [any_value].
   - A tag is any integer, where the compiler's [Tag.Scannable.t] is at
     least 0 and below 251. The field and the size of a [Block_load]
     are any integers too, where the compiler's are signed integers of
     63 bits ([Target_ocaml_int.t]). A primitive with a number out of
     its range is one the compiler cannot build. No type here refuses
     it: FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.prim_in_range is the test, and a unit
     that passes the check FlambdaWellFormedSpec.numbers_in_range has
     no such primitive.
   - The comparisons are those of integers only: the compiler's
     [comparison] and [comparison_behaviour] are polymorphic in the
     signedness so as to serve the floats too, which are not here. Their
     constructors are prefixed with [Int_], as [Eq], [Lt] and [Gt] are
     Rocq's.
   - [signedness] is both [Flambda_primitive.signed_or_unsigned] and
     [Scalar.Signedness.t], which have the same constructors.
   - The constructors of [equality_comparison] are prefixed with
     [Phys_], for the same reason: the compiler's are [Eq] and [Neq].
   - [String_length] has no [string_or_bytes]: it is the length of a
     string ([String]). The model has no bytes, which are mutable, and
     the conversion must refuse [Bytes].
   - [Num_conv] is between two [Standard_int.t], where the compiler's is
     between two [Standard_int_or_float.t], a record of [src] and
     [dst]: the conversions to and from the two kinds of float are not
     here, and the conversion must refuse them.
   - The unary [Int_arith] of the compiler is [Unary_int_arith] here, as
     [Int_arith] is the binary one.
   - [reinterpret_64_bit_word] has the two of the compiler's
     [Reinterpret_64_bit_word.t] that are between integers. The two
     that are between an int64 and a float are not here, and the
     conversion must refuse them.
   - [String_or_bigstring_load] has no [string_like_value]: it is the
     load from a string ([String]), and the conversion must refuse
     [Bytes] and [Bigstring]. The only [string_accessor_width]s are
     those of an integer of one, two, four or eight bytes; the
     conversion must refuse the others ([Single], which loads a float,
     the three of vectors, and [Mask]).
   - The only arrays are those whose elements are of kind [Value]:
     [array_kind] has [Immediates], [Gc_ignorable_values] and [Values]
     of the compiler's [Array_kind.t], and the conversion must refuse
     the others (the arrays of floats, of naked numbers, of vectors and
     of masks, and [Unboxed_product]). [array_load_kind] and
     [array_set_kind] have the same three of [Array_load_kind.t] and of
     [Array_set_kind.t]. The constructors are prefixed with [Array_],
     [Load_] and [Set_]: the three types of the compiler have the same
     names in three modules. [Float_array_opt_dynamic], the kind of an
     [Array_length] of an array that may be one of floats, is here: the
     model has no array of floats, and the conversion must refuse the
     load and the store that the front end makes for the case of
     floats.
   - [Make_array] is [Make_mutable_array], with no mutability and no
     allocation mode: it is the allocation on the heap of an array
     that is [Mutable], and the conversion must refuse the others.
     ([Immutable_unique] is not a mutability of arrays: Simplify stops
     on a [Make_array] that has it. An array made [Immutable] is a
     value with no identity, as an immutable block is, and the values
     of the model have not got one yet.)
   - The conversion must refuse an [Array_set] whose array kind is
     [Values] and whose set kind is not. The front end makes none, and
     Simplify stops on one unless the type of the array lets it change
     the array kind to [Immediates] first
     ([Simplify_ternary_primitive.simplify_array_set], after
     [Simplify_common.specialise_array_kind]).

   To add a primitive: add its constructor here, its case to the
   evaluation, to the kinds and to [prim_in_range] of
   FlambdaPrimitiveSpec.v, and its case to the proofs of the laws of
   that file, in FlambdaPrimitiveProofs.v. Nothing else in the model
   looks inside a primitive. *)

   comparison of two such blocks is [Phys_equal] above: the prototype
   says what they do on a location (FlambdaHeapSpec.v). The two
   primitives of arrays that are here are with them for the same
   reason: in the change itself [Make_array] is a variadic primitive
