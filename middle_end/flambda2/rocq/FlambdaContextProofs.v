(* Proofs of the statements of FlambdaContextSpec.v. Nothing here needs
   review.

   A hole in the body of a binder is one step away from the premise. A hole
   in a handler is not: the handler goes into a closure, which is applied
   later, any number of times. So the proof relates continuation
   environments whose closures have related handlers ([cont_env_related]),
   and shows that one expression under two related environments ends alike
   ([transfer]), by induction on the length of the run: where a closure is
   applied, the induction gives the first handler under the second
   environment, and the relation of the handlers then gives the second
   handler there. Divergence needs no argument of its own
   (FlambdaSemanticsProofs.equivalent_of_terminating).

   A hole in code is the same again for the static environment: the proof
   relates static environments whose code has related bodies
   ([statics_related]), and where the code is called the induction gives
   the first body under the second environments. Values hold code ids and
   not code, so the values of the two runs stay equal.

   The relations may rely on a predicate on states that a step keeps
   ([inv]): corresponding handlers, and corresponding code, need only be
   related from the states that have it, where they have it together. The
   lemmas named [_from] are that. The lemmas named [_where] are the case
   of a property of the static environment that, once it holds, holds of
   every extension: what a name is bound to never changes
   (FlambdaWellFormedSpec.v), so a handler may be rewritten using the
   bindings made before its definition. *)
