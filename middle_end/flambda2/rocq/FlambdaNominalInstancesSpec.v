(* The terms of Flambda 2 as things that contain names, and their binders
   as name abstractions: instances of the interface of
   FlambdaNameAbstractionSpec.v.

   This file is to be reviewed: the instances (which action, which free
   names and which equality each has), and the statements.

   FlambdaNameAbstractionSpec.v has the interface of the compiler's
   nominal/ directory with its laws, and mentions no term. Here it meets
   the model. An instance is for one sort of name: the variables or the
   continuations. A renaming of one sort is a renaming of
   FlambdaNominalSpec.v whose other permutation is empty.

   What has no binder is an instance with [=] for its equality: a
   [simple], a [named], a static constant, and an environment of
   variables, whose names are the variables it binds. A value holds no
   variable and no continuation: it is [Nominal.no_names].

   Expressions. The equality of expressions is alpha-equivalence
   (FlambdaAlphaSpec.alpha_equivalent), and their free names are those
   of FlambdaBindersSpec.v. The laws hold of the expressions whose code
   is closed, and not of the others: a binder around code that is not
   closed counts as binding what the code leaves free, but the code
   does not see it when it runs, so a renaming that fixes the free
   names of such a term can change it. Code is closed in every
   well-formed term (decision D31). So the instance is on
   [closed_expr], the expressions whose code is closed. A renaming
   keeps code closed (FlambdaAlphaSpec.code_closed_equivariant_statement),
   so the action is [rename_expr]; the definition tests the result,
   since a definition here cannot use a proof, and
   [rename_closed_expr_term_statement] says that the test never fails.

   The binders. Each binder of the model is a name abstraction of the
   interface over closed expressions, and so has all its laws
   (FlambdaNameAbstractionSpec.abstraction_nominal_statement,
   [pattern_match_pair_statement]) with no further proof. What is
   proved here is that the term built from an abstraction depends on
   the abstraction only up to its equality: two abstractions that are
   equal in the sense of the interface give alpha-equivalent terms.
   This is the sense in which a binder of the model is a
   [Name_abstraction.t]:
   - the variable of a [Let] ([let_abstraction_statement]);
   - the continuation of a non-recursive [Let_cont]
     ([let_cont_abstraction_statement]);
   - the parameters of a handler ([handler_abstraction_statement]);
   - the parameters and [my_closure] of code, and its return and
     exception continuations ([code_variables_abstraction_statement],
     [code_continuations_abstraction_statement]).
   The continuations of a recursive [Let_cont] bind in its handlers and
   in its body together; that scope is not one expression, and it is
   not stated here as an abstraction
   (FlambdaAlphaSpec.alpha_let_cont_recursive_statement says that a
   renaming of them gives an alpha-equivalent term).

   A state is not made an instance: the action on states and the
   equivariance of the machine are in FlambdaEquivarianceSpec.v, stated
   directly.

   Nothing is trusted here. The proofs are in
   FlambdaNominalInstancesProofs.v, which needs no review. *)
