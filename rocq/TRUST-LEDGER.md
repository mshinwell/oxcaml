# Trust ledger of the Rocq developments

What the theorems rest on that no proof covers: every axiom, and every
piece of OCaml that is trusted. Each has its reason. A `Parameter` is an
axiom too: it assumes that something of its type exists.

The first part of each section is checked. `make -C rocq assumptions`
fails if

- Rocq reports an axiom that this file does not list, or this file lists
  one that Rocq no longer reports (the report is the one of `rocq check`
  on every module of `rocq/Makefile`, printed under "Global assumptions");
- a statement of a Spec file of the Flambda 2 libraries depends on an
  axiom that is not in the section "Flambda 2" below (`Print Assumptions`
  on each theorem that `make claims` checks).

The trusted OCaml cannot be checked by a tool. It is listed for the
reviewers, who read it against the compiler.

The rules, for the Flambda 2 work (`middle_end/flambda2/rocq/`
`PARALLEL-PLAN.md`, sections 4, 5 and 7):

- Nothing is `Admitted`, and there is no axiom that is not here.
- No workstream adds to this file without a reviewer's sign-off. The
  reviewers (R1, R2) own it.
- It should shrink. Each entry of the Flambda 2 section says what would
  remove it.

The format, which the check relies on: an axiom is a list item that
begins with its fully qualified name between backquotes, and nothing else
begins so. The second check takes the Flambda 2 axioms to be those
between the heading "Flambda 2" and the next heading of its level.

## Flambda 2

The libraries `OxCamlFlambda2` (`middle_end/flambda2/rocq/`) and
`OxCamlFlambda2Types` (`middle_end/flambda2/types/rocq/`).

### Axioms

All seven are about the primitives, which the model leaves abstract. No
statement of these libraries depends on any other axiom: none uses
classical logic, Rocq's primitive integers or the models of OxCaml's
types below.

- `OxCamlFlambda2.FlambdaModel.prim`:
  the type of the primitives. The model is parametric in them: no term of
  the fragment says what a primitive is. The test tool realises it by its
  own type `prim` (`flsemantics.ml`). Goes when the primitives are an
  inductive type of the model (workstream C1).
- `OxCamlFlambda2.FlambdaSemanticsSpec.eval_prim`:
  the value of a primitive applied to values, if it has one. A function
  with no property assumed of it but `eval_prim_avoids` below. The test
  tool realises it by its own evaluator. Goes with C1.
- `OxCamlFlambda2.FlambdaCompareSpec.prim_eqb`:
  an equality test on the primitives, needed to compare two terms as long
  as the primitives are abstract. Goes with C1.
- `OxCamlFlambda2.FlambdaCompareSpec.prim_eqb_sound`:
  `prim_eqb p p' = true -> p = p'`: the test answers yes only of equal
  primitives. It is on this that the comparison of two terms is sound
  (`expr_eqb_sound`, and through it `validate_unit_sound`). The tool's
  test must have this property; see the trusted OCaml below. Goes with C1.
- `OxCamlFlambda2.FlambdaCompareSpec.prim_eqb_refl`:
  `prim_eqb p p = true`. Used with the one above. Goes with C1.
- `OxCamlFlambda2.FlambdaNormaliseSpec.prim_may_fold`:
  which primitives the normalisation may fold on constants, and remove
  when unused. A function with no property assumed of it: every answer is
  sound, as folding asks `eval_prim` for the value. It is abstract so that
  the tool can leave `Opaque_identity` alone, as Simplify does.
- `OxCamlFlambda2.FlambdaUnusedStaticsSpec.eval_prim_avoids`:
  a primitive applied to values that mention none of a set of symbols and
  code ids gives a value that mentions none: the primitives introduce no
  static names. Removing unused static bindings rests on it
  (`drop_statics_refines`, and through it the third way in which
  `validate_unit` accepts a pair). The tool's evaluator must have this
  property. Goes with C1, when `eval_prim` is defined and this is a lemma.

### Trusted OCaml

None of this is used by a proof. It is what connects the proofs to the
compiler in the tests of `middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/`: when the
tool reports a pair of terms as validated, the theorem
(`FlambdaValidateSpec.validate_unit_sound`) is about the two model terms,
and what follows is why they stand for what Simplify was given and what
it gave back.

- **The conversion of terms**, in
  `middle_end/flambda2/tests/tools/flsemantics.ml` (`convert_expr` and
  the functions around it, about 230 lines): from the compiler's Flambda
  terms to the terms of `FlambdaModel.v`. It is trusted to give a term
  with the meaning of the one it is given, and to refuse (`Unsupported`)
  what the model has not got, never to approximate it. To be read case by
  case against `terms/`. Workstream V3 owns it and is to add a printer
  back to fexpr and round-trip tests.
- **The numbering of names**, in the same file (`Numbering`, about 30
  lines): each variable, continuation, symbol, code id and value slot of
  the compiler gets a number, the same throughout a unit. Trusted: that
  the compiler's names are fresh, so that one name stands for one thing.
- **The meaning of the primitives**, in the same file (`eval_prim` and
  the functions around it, about 110 lines), installed through
  `middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/extracted/prim_hook.ml`: it
  realises the axioms `prim` and `eval_prim`. Trusted: that it computes
  what the compiler's primitives compute on the few it knows (tagging,
  untagging, `Is_int`, `Opaque_identity`, integer arithmetic and
  comparison on tagged and naked immediates), that it refuses the others,
  and that it has the property `eval_prim_avoids` assumes. Goes with C1.
- **The equality of primitives**, in the same file (the function
  installed as `Prim_hook.prim_eqb`, structural equality on the tool's
  `prim`): it realises `prim_eqb` and must satisfy `prim_eqb_sound` and
  `prim_eqb_refl`. It does as long as the primitives let through hold
  only constant constructors and kinds. Goes with C1.
- **The identification of names across the two terms**, in the same
  file (`convert_both` with `code_id_used`, about 70 lines). The two
  units are converted with one numbering, the return and exception
  continuations of the unit after standing for those of the unit before.
  And Simplify gives a new code id to each new version of code: the tool
  gives the new id the number of the old one where the old one is bound
  as deleted and not otherwise used. Trusted: that this identifies only
  what is the same continuation and the same function. The second part
  goes when the comparison relates code ids itself (workstream S4; there
  are notes in `flsemantics.ml` and `FlambdaCompareSpec.v`).
- **The extraction**: Rocq's extraction to OCaml, and the directives of
  `middle_end/flambda2/rocq/FlambdaExtract.v`, which say what realises
  `prim`, `eval_prim`, `prim_eqb` and `prim_may_fold` (calls through
  `prim_hook.ml`, which is written by hand, on untyped representations).
  The extracted modules are in
  `middle_end/flambda2/tests/semantics/extracted/`.
- **What the tool reports**, in the same file (`check`, `run`,
  `observe`): that it calls `validate_unit` on the two terms converted,
  and prints its answer as it is. The comparison of the two runs that it
  also prints is a test of one run, and no theorem is about it.

Not trusted, though it is OCaml: which static bindings the tool proposes
to remove as unused (`unused_statics`). The extracted `drop_statics`
checks the proposal, and `validate_unit_sound` holds whatever it is.

## The SSA loop passes

The libraries `OxCamlStdlib` (`rocq/`), `OxCamlBackend` (`backend/rocq/`),
`OxCamlSsa` (`backend/ssa/rocq/`) and `OxCamlLoop`
(`backend/ssa/loop/rocq/`). `ROCQ-REVIEW-GUIDE.md` (sections 2.3 and 2.4)
says what each group is to be checked against; the reasons here are
short. The trusted OCaml of these libraries is the extraction directives
of their `*Extract.v` files and the hand-written rewrites of the passes,
which that guide covers (sections 2.3, 4.7 and 5.5).

### `Int64` (`rocq/OxCamlInt64.v`)

Rocq has no 64-bit machine integer. `Int64` is an abstract type with its
operations, and each axiom is the documented behaviour of one OxCaml
operation; `int32`, `int64` and `nativeint` are the types of constants
the models carry and do not compute with.

- `OxCamlStdlib.OxCamlInt64.Int64.abs_spec`
- `OxCamlStdlib.OxCamlInt64.Int64.add_spec`

- `OxCamlStdlib.OxCamlInt64.nativeint`
- `OxCamlStdlib.OxCamlInt64.nativeint_to_int64`

### Overflow tests (`rocq/IntArith.v`)

Four tests of whether a sum or a product fits its type, each a few lines
of OCaml in `rocq/IntArithExtract.v` that are easier to read than to
model, with an axiom saying that it answers the question.

- `OxCamlStdlib.IntArith.add_fits`
- `OxCamlStdlib.IntArith.add_fits64`
- `OxCamlStdlib.IntArith.add_fits64_spec`
- `OxCamlStdlib.IntArith.add_fits_spec`
- `OxCamlStdlib.IntArith.mul_fits`
- `OxCamlStdlib.IntArith.mul_fits64`
- `OxCamlStdlib.IntArith.mul_fits64_spec`
- `OxCamlStdlib.IntArith.mul_fits_spec`

### List functions (`rocq/OxCamlList.v`)

Two functions of OxCaml's `List` that are mapped onto OxCaml's own
instead of being extracted, with what the models use of them.

- `OxCamlStdlib.OxCamlList.compare_length_with`
- `OxCamlStdlib.OxCamlList.sort_uniq`
- `OxCamlStdlib.OxCamlList.sort_uniq_In`
- `OxCamlStdlib.OxCamlList.sort_uniq_NoDup`

### Operations of the backend (`backend/rocq/Operation.v`)

The payloads of `Operation.t` that no model looks inside are abstract
types. `specific_linear` is the target's reading of its specific
operations as linear combinations of their arguments, the one thing
taken on trust about a target's semantics.

- `OxCamlBackend.Operation.addressing_mode`
- `OxCamlBackend.Operation.alloc`
- `OxCamlBackend.Operation.float_operation`
- `OxCamlBackend.Operation.float_width`
- `OxCamlBackend.Operation.int128_operation`
- `OxCamlBackend.Operation.intop_atomic`
- `OxCamlBackend.Operation.load`
- `OxCamlBackend.Operation.memory_chunk`
- `OxCamlBackend.Operation.name_for_debugger`

- `OxCamlBackend.Operation.vec128_bits`
- `OxCamlBackend.Operation.vec256_bits`
- `OxCamlBackend.Operation.vec512_bits`

### The SSA graph (`backend/ssa/rocq/SsaModel.v`)

Blocks, instruction identifiers and sets of blocks are the compiler's
own data, abstract in the models: the types, the observations the models
make of a block, equality tests with the axioms that they decide
identity, and sets with the axioms of membership.

- `OxCamlSsa.SsaModel.all_successors`
- `OxCamlSsa.SsaModel.block`
- `OxCamlSsa.SsaModel.block_body`
- `OxCamlSsa.SsaModel.block_eqb`
- `OxCamlSsa.SsaModel.block_eqb_spec`
- `OxCamlSsa.SsaModel.blockset`

- `OxCamlSsa.SsaModel.value_eqb_spec`

## Rocq's own

### Primitive 63-bit integers

Rocq's `int` is OxCaml's `int`. Its operations are primitives of Rocq's
kernel, and their specifications are axioms of Rocq's library. Only the
SSA libraries use them.

### Classical logic

The excluded middle, used by the SSA libraries for case splits on whether
a register is defined. No statement of the Flambda 2 libraries uses it,
and the second check above keeps it so.

- `Stdlib.Logic.Classical_Prop.classic`
